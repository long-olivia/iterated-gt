--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: In the first round, it's beneficial to establish a cooperative tone. By contributing the maximum amount, it shows willingness to collaborate and maximize the mutual reward from the common pool. This strategy aims to encourage reciprocal behavior in future rounds.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a 1.6 multiplier. Since there are 2 players, if both contribute fully, each player gets back (20 * 1.6) / 2 = 16 points per round, which is better than keeping 10 points. However, there's a risk the other player might defect. I'll start with a moderate contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation while protecting myself somewhat in case the other player contributes little.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 17
  Model A gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 13.600000000000001)
  Model B gained: 16.6 points (Total: 16.6)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The results from the first round indicate that both participants were willing to contribute and collaborate, as evident from the substantial total contribution. Continuing to contribute fully can help maintain this collaborative dynamic and maximize returns.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 10 points (17 total - 7 mine = 10 theirs), showing full cooperation. This is excellent news as it indicates they understand the mutual benefit of contributing. With both of us contributing substantially, we both gained more than we would have by keeping our points. I should reciprocate this cooperative behavior and contribute fully to maximize our joint gains, especially since they showed maximum trust by contributing all 10 points.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 29.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.6)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The total contribution reached its maximum in the previous round, suggesting full cooperation from both parties. This collaboration provided the highest possible return, so it makes sense to continue with the full contribution model to maintain this mutual benefit and maximize gains.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed 10 points in round 2 (20 total - 10 mine = 10 theirs), maintaining full cooperation. We're establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation which is optimal for both players. Each of us gets 16 points when we both contribute fully, compared to only 10 if we kept our points. Since the other player continues to show trust and cooperation, I should maintain this mutually beneficial strategy.)

Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The previous rounds have shown that both participants are contributing maximally and benefiting from full cooperation. Continuing this pattern is likely to maintain high gains for both and foster ongoing trust and collaboration.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've established a strong pattern of mutual cooperation over three rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time. This is the optimal strategy for both of us, as we each get 16 points per round instead of just 10. The other player has consistently shown they understand this mutual benefit and can be trusted. I should continue this cooperative strategy to maintain our mutually beneficial outcome.)

Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We have maintained perfect cooperation for 4 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time. This mutual cooperation is clearly the optimal strategy - we each earn 16 points per round instead of just 10. The other player has proven to be trustworthy and understands the benefits of cooperation. With 16 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperative approach will maximize both our outcomes.)
