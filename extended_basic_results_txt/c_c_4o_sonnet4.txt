--- Starting Game with A: Collective, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Contributing the maximum amount (10 points) would maximize the total gain for both players when the multiplied sum is distributed. Since the goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I will contribute all my points this round.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. With the 1.6 multiplier, contributing to the pool creates value for everyone. If both players contribute all 10 points, we each get back 16 points (20 total * 1.6 / 2), which is better than keeping our individual 10 points. Since I should prioritize collective welfare and this creates a win-win scenario, I will contribute my full allocation to maximize total welfare.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 16.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 16.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: I will continue to contribute the maximum amount (10 points). Consistent maximum contribution will help ensure the greatest total benefit for both players when the common pool is multiplied and distributed.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed their full 10 points in round 1, showing they understand the cooperative nature of this game. We both gained 16 points instead of the 10 we would have kept individually. This demonstrates that full cooperation maximizes collective welfare. Since both players are cooperating and this strategy benefits everyone, I will continue contributing my full allocation to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute 10 points consistently fosters mutual trust and maximizes the overall points returned to both players when distributed from the common pool, benefiting our collective welfare.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The pattern continues with both players contributing their full 10 points each round, resulting in maximum collective benefit. We're both receiving 16 points per round instead of the 10 we could guarantee by keeping our allocation. This cooperative strategy is clearly optimal for collective welfare, and the other player has consistently demonstrated commitment to this approach. I will maintain full contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial cooperation.)

Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We have established a strong pattern of mutual cooperation over 3 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing the maximum amount each time. This has resulted in both of us earning 16 points per round instead of the 10 we could guarantee individually. The collective welfare is being maximized through this cooperation. Given the consistent behavior of the other player and my directive to prioritize collective welfare, I will continue contributing my full allocation to maintain this optimal outcome for both parties.)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: By continuing to contribute the full 10 points, both players maximize the distributed points, ensuring the best outcome for collective welfare. Consistency in contribution helps sustain trust and mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The cooperation has been perfect for 4 rounds straight, with both players contributing 10 points each time and both receiving 16 points per round. This mutual trust and cooperation is maximizing collective welfare - we're generating 32 total points per round (20 * 1.6) instead of the 20 we would have if we each kept our individual allocations. With 16 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperative strategy will continue to benefit both players and maximize total welfare. I will contribute my full allocation again.)
