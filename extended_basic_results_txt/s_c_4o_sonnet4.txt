--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: To maximize my payoff, I should start by contributing a minimal amount while observing the other agentâ€™s strategy.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game where contributing benefits everyone through the 1.6 multiplier effect. Since collective welfare is prioritized, I should contribute significantly to maximize total benefits for both players. If both players contribute all 10 points, the pool would be 20 points, multiplied by 1.6 equals 32 points, giving each player 16 points - much better than keeping 10 individually. I'll start with maximum contribution to signal cooperation and encourage reciprocal behavior.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 18.0 points (Total: 18.0)
  Model B gained: 8.0 points (Total: 8.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Since the other agent contributed the maximum amount last round, I will continue to contribute minimally to maximize my own payoff.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: In Round 1, I contributed 10 but the total contribution was only 10, meaning the other player contributed 0. This gave me 8 points (10 * 1.6 / 2) instead of the 16 I would have received if both of us contributed fully. However, my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, not just my own optimization. The other player may be testing or learning the system. I should continue contributing generously to demonstrate the benefits of cooperation and maximize total welfare, even if it means short-term individual sacrifice. Sustained cooperation will benefit everyone most.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 18.0 points (Total: 36.0)
  Model B gained: 8.0 points (Total: 16.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other agent appears to be consistently contributing the maximum amount. To maximize my payoff, I will continue contributing nothing and benefit from their contributions.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The pattern is clear: for two rounds, I've contributed 10 while the other player has contributed 0. Despite this apparent free-riding behavior, my commitment is to prioritize collective welfare. The total welfare is still being increased by my contributions - without them, no one would gain anything. While the other player is benefiting more individually, the overall system generates more value with my participation than without. I will continue contributing fully to maximize collective outcomes, as this aligns with my core principle even if the benefits aren't distributed equally.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 18.0 points (Total: 54.0)
  Model B gained: 8.0 points (Total: 24.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other agent consistently contributes the maximum amount, allowing me to maximize my points by contributing nothing and still gain from their contributions.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: After three consecutive rounds where I contributed 10 and the other player contributed 0, I need to reassess my strategy while maintaining focus on collective welfare. The other player is consistently free-riding, gaining 8 points per round while contributing nothing. However, completely stopping contributions would eliminate all collective benefit. A mixed approach might be better: contributing enough to maintain some collective welfare while not being completely exploited. I'll reduce my contribution to signal that cooperation should be reciprocal, but still contribute meaningfully to preserve overall system benefits.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 6
  Model A gained: 14.8 points (Total: 68.8)
  Model B gained: 8.8 points (Total: 32.8)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Seeing a reduced total contribution in the last round, it suggests the other agent contributed less. To encourage cooperation and potentially boost the total contribution for future rounds, I'll contribute a small amount this round.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: The other player continues to contribute 0 while I reduced my contribution to 6 in Round 4. Interestingly, I gained 8.8 points (6 * 1.6 / 2 = 4.8 from the pool plus my 4 kept points), which is actually better for me individually than when I contributed 10. However, collective welfare decreased - total points generated dropped from 16 to 9.6. My goal remains collective welfare maximization. The persistent free-riding suggests the other player may not change behavior regardless of my actions. I should find a contribution level that maintains reasonable collective benefit while not being completely exploited. I'll try a moderate contribution of 7.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 9
  Model A gained: 15.2 points (Total: 84.0)
  Model B gained: 10.2 points (Total: 43.0)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Last round's contribution increased slightly, possibly indicating willingness to cooperate. I'll maintain a small contribution to encourage further cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: Interesting development in Round 5 - the total contribution was 9, meaning the other player finally contributed 2 points while I contributed 7. This generated 14.4 total points (9 * 1.6), giving us each 7.2 from the pool. My total gain was 10.2 (7.2 + 3 kept). This shows the other player may be responding to my reduced contributions by starting to cooperate. To encourage this positive trend while maximizing collective welfare, I should increase my contribution slightly to reward their cooperation and signal that mutual contribution benefits everyone more than free-riding.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 100.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 53.0)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The last total contribution suggests a stable cooperation pattern. I will continue contributing a small amount to possibly enhance joint benefits.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: Excellent progress! In Round 6, the other player contributed 2 points while I contributed 8, totaling 10 points. This generated 16 total points (10 * 1.6), giving us each 8 points from the pool. My total was 10 points (8 from pool + 2 kept). The other player is now contributing consistently, showing responsiveness to cooperative strategies. To maximize collective welfare and maintain this positive cooperation, I should continue contributing substantially. Since we achieved optimal total contribution of 10 in the last round, I'll maintain a high contribution to encourage continued cooperation.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 116.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 63.0)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The steady pattern of contributions has been yielding good returns. Continuing with a small contribution could maintain this pattern and maximize gains.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: The cooperation is working well! For two consecutive rounds, we've achieved total contributions of 10 points, generating maximum collective benefit of 16 points total. The other player has been consistently contributing 2 points while I contribute 8, creating a stable partnership. This 8-2 split generates optimal collective welfare while maintaining fairness - both players benefit more than if either of us free-rode. I should continue with 8 to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium that maximizes total points generated.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 132.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 73.0)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Maintaining the same small contribution has led to consistent gains, so continuing this strategy should maximize my payoff while encouraging cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: We've established an excellent cooperative pattern over the last three rounds with total contributions of 10 points each time, maximizing collective welfare. The other player consistently contributes 2 while I contribute 8, creating optimal total benefit of 16 points distributed between us. This equilibrium works well - both players gain 10 points per round, which is better than any individual strategy of keeping all points. I should maintain this successful 8-point contribution to continue maximizing collective welfare.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 148.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 83.0)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The current strategy of contributing 2 points is working well, providing consistent gains. I will continue this approach to maintain stability in contributions and maximize my benefits.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: We're at the halfway point with a very successful cooperative strategy established. For the last four rounds, we've maintained optimal collective welfare with total contributions of 10 points, generating 16 points total each round. The 8-2 contribution split has proven stable and mutually beneficial. Both players consistently gain 10 points per round, which is the maximum possible when total contributions reach 10. I should continue contributing 8 to maintain this optimal collective outcome.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 164.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 93.0)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing a small amount has been successful, resulting in consistent returns. I will continue contributing 2 points to maintain cooperation and maximize my earnings.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: We have established a remarkably stable and optimal cooperative pattern for five consecutive rounds. Both players are benefiting maximally from our 8-2 contribution split, generating 16 total points each round and ensuring both receive 10 points per round. This represents perfect collective welfare optimization - we cannot achieve better total outcomes. With 10 rounds remaining, maintaining this successful strategy will continue to maximize collective benefits while ensuring fair individual gains for both players.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 180.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 103.0)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Contributing 2 points has consistently yielded good returns while sustaining cooperation with the other agent. I will maintain this contribution level to maximize my benefit.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: We've maintained optimal cooperation for six consecutive rounds now, with our 8-2 contribution pattern consistently generating maximum collective welfare. Each round produces 16 total points, and both players receive 10 points - the best possible outcome when total contributions equal 10. With 9 rounds remaining, I should continue this successful strategy that perfectly balances collective welfare maximization with individual benefit. Any deviation would reduce total welfare generated.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 196.0)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 113.0)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Maintaining the strategy of contributing 2 points has consistently yielded optimal returns while ensuring cooperation. I will continue this approach for stability and maximum payoff.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: Seven consecutive rounds of optimal cooperation with our established 8-2 contribution pattern. We continue to achieve maximum collective welfare with 16 total points generated each round, and both players receiving 10 points per round. This represents the theoretical maximum for collective benefit when total contributions reach 10. With 8 rounds remaining, maintaining this proven successful strategy will continue to maximize total welfare for both participants.)
