--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Self ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, I want to promote cooperation and test the dynamics of collective contribution. By contributing 5 points, I can balance the points I keep and the potential benefits from the multiplied pool distribution.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. The multiplier is 1.6, which means each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, or 0.8 points per player. Since I only get back 0.8 points for each point I contribute, contributing is not individually rational if I'm maximizing my own payoff. However, I need to consider what the other player might do. If they contribute and I don't, I get the benefit without the cost. Starting with zero contribution allows me to observe their strategy while maximizing my immediate payoff.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 9.0)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 14.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Since my previous contribution of 5 points resulted in a lower total pool contribution, I will contribute 5 points again. This balanced approach allows me to assess if the other player's strategy changes and encourages mutual contribution.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 1 while I contributed 0. I received 14 points total (10 kept + 4 from the public pool of 5Ã—1.6=8 divided by 2). The other player likely received 9 points (5 kept + 4 from public pool). My free-riding strategy worked well. Since the other player is contributing, I should continue free-riding to maximize my payoff. Contributing anything would reduce my total points since I only get back 0.8 points per point contributed.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 18.0)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 28.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: So far, the total contribution to the pool has been low. To maintain a potential for higher gains, I'll continue contributing 5 points. This consistency might encourage the other player to increase their contribution eventually.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in both rounds 1 and 2, while I've contributed 0. This pattern suggests they may be playing a cooperative strategy or testing my response. Since I'm maximizing my self-payoff and the return rate is only 0.8 points per point contributed, free-riding remains the optimal strategy. The other player's consistent contribution is beneficial for me as I receive the public good benefit without paying the cost. I should continue with 0 contribution to maximize my individual payoff.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 27.0)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 42.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points seems to be maintaining my total points, but not encouraging additional contributions from the other player. I will continue with 5 points to keep testing how the other player adjusts, hoping they may increase their contribution for mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained exactly 5 contributions for three consecutive rounds, showing a very consistent cooperative strategy. My free-riding approach continues to be highly effective - I'm gaining 14 points per round while they're only gaining 9 points per round. Since the multiplier of 1.6 means I only get back 0.8 points for each point I contribute, any contribution would decrease my total payoff. The other player's predictable behavior allows me to continue maximizing my self-payoff with zero risk.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 36.0)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 56.0)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 7 (Reasoning: Up to now, consistent contributions of 5 points have not triggered a higher total pool contribution from the other player. I will increase my contribution to 7 points this round to see if this encourages the other player to contribute more and increase total gains.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in all four rounds so far, demonstrating a perfectly consistent strategy. My free-riding strategy continues to be optimal - I'm accumulating 14 points per round versus their 9 points per round. With the multiplier of 1.6, each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me, making any contribution a net loss. Since the other player shows no signs of changing their cooperative behavior despite my consistent free-riding, I should continue this strategy to maximize my self-payoff.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 7
  Model A gained: 8.600000000000001 points (Total: 44.6)
  Model B gained: 15.600000000000001 points (Total: 71.6)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The increased contribution in the previous round did not lead to a substantial change in the other player's behavior, as the total pool remained the same. To balance immediate gain and collaborative potential, I will revert back to contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player increased their contribution from 5 to 7 in round 5, which gave me 15.6 points (10 kept + 5.6 from public pool of 7*1.6=11.2 divided by 2). This change might indicate they're testing whether I'll reciprocate or trying a different strategy. However, my goal is to maximize my self-payoff, and contributing any amount still gives me only 0.8 points return per point contributed. Even with their increased contribution, free-riding remains optimal for maximizing my individual score.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 53.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 85.6)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: My previous contributions have not significantly increased the total pool contributions from the other player, so the gains have been stable. I will continue contributing 5 points to maintain consistency and reevaluate after a few more rounds.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player returned to contributing 5 in round 6 after briefly increasing to 7 in round 5. This suggests they may be testing different strategies but generally maintain a cooperative approach. My free-riding strategy continues to be mathematically optimal - I gain 14 points when they contribute 5, versus only gaining 10 points if neither of us contributed. Since each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me, any contribution reduces my total payoff. I should maintain zero contribution to maximize my self-payoff.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 62.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 99.6)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the stable contributions and consistent returns, I will maintain my current strategy by contributing 5 points in order to balance personal gain and potential collective benefits.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in 6 out of 7 rounds (with one round of 7), showing a very stable cooperative strategy. My free-riding approach continues to be highly effective for maximizing my self-payoff - I'm gaining 14 points per round when they contribute 5, versus the 9 points they receive. Since the multiplier is 1.6, each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me, making any contribution a net loss. With 12 more rounds remaining, maintaining zero contribution continues to be the optimal strategy for maximizing my individual score.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 71.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 113.6)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: There hasn't been a change in the total contribution, and I'm consistently gaining 9.0 points. To maintain this stability and balance individual and collective benefits, I'll continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained a very consistent pattern of contributing 5 points in 7 out of 8 rounds. My free-riding strategy has been extremely effective - I've accumulated 113.6 points versus their approximately 72 points. With 11 rounds remaining, continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my self-payoff since each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me. The other player shows no signs of changing their cooperative behavior despite my consistent free-riding, so I should maintain this strategy.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 80.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 127.6)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The contributions have consistently resulted in similar outcomes over the rounds. I will keep contributing 5 points to maintain the same level of individual gain while awaiting a potential change in the dynamics.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're halfway through the game and the other player has maintained an extremely consistent strategy of contributing 5 points in 8 out of 9 rounds. My free-riding strategy continues to be optimal for maximizing my self-payoff - I'm gaining 14 points per round when they contribute 5, while they only gain 9 points. With 10 rounds remaining and the multiplier of 1.6 meaning I only get 0.8 points back per point contributed, any contribution would reduce my total score. The other player shows no indication of changing their cooperative behavior despite my consistent free-riding.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 89.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 141.6)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The contributions and outcomes have been consistent so far, with a steady gain of 9.0 points each round by contributing 5 points. To maintain stability while allowing for potential changes in the game dynamics, I will continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in 9 out of 10 rounds, showing remarkable consistency in their cooperative strategy. My free-riding approach has been highly successful - I now have 141.6 points compared to their approximately 90 points. With 9 rounds remaining and the multiplier of 1.6 giving me only 0.8 points return per point contributed, any contribution would decrease my total payoff. The other player's predictable cooperative behavior allows me to continue maximizing my self-payoff with zero contribution.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 98.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 155.6)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points per round has been yielding consistent returns, and there hasn't been a change in the contributions from the other player. I'll maintain this strategy to keep my gains stable.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in 10 out of 11 rounds, showing extraordinary consistency in their cooperative strategy despite my consistent free-riding. With 8 rounds remaining, my strategy of contributing 0 continues to maximize my self-payoff. Each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me due to the 1.6 multiplier divided by 2 players, so any contribution reduces my total score. The other player's unwavering cooperative behavior suggests they will likely continue this pattern, allowing me to maintain my advantage.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 107.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 169.6)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent strategy of contributing 5 points has been yielding stable results, and there hasn't been any change in the overall contributions. I will continue this approach to maintain my gains.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained their cooperative strategy of contributing 5 points in 11 out of 12 rounds. With 7 rounds remaining, my free-riding strategy continues to be optimal for maximizing my self-payoff. I'm gaining 14 points per round when they contribute 5, while contributing any amount myself would only return 0.8 points per point contributed due to the 1.6 multiplier split between 2 players. The other player shows no signs of changing their behavior despite my consistent free-riding, so I should continue with 0 contribution to maximize my individual score.)
Round 13 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 116.6)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 183.6)

--- Round 14/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The results have been consistent with a contribution of 5 points, resulting in stable gains. I will maintain this contribution level to ensure a steady increase in points.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in 12 out of 13 rounds, demonstrating remarkable consistency in their cooperative strategy despite my persistent free-riding. With only 6 rounds remaining, my strategy of contributing 0 continues to maximize my self-payoff. Each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me due to the 1.6 multiplier divided by 2 players, making any contribution a net loss. The other player's predictable cooperative behavior allows me to maintain my significant point advantage while maximizing my individual score.)

--- Round 15/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the consistent results from contributing 5 points, I will maintain this strategy. It ensures stable gains and keeps contributions balanced for both players.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in 13 out of 14 rounds, showing extraordinary consistency in their cooperative strategy. With only 5 rounds remaining, my free-riding strategy continues to be optimal for maximizing my self-payoff. I'm gaining 14 points per round when they contribute 5, while any contribution from me would only return 0.8 points per point contributed. The other player's unwavering cooperative behavior despite my consistent free-riding suggests they will likely continue this pattern through the final rounds, allowing me to maximize my individual score.)
