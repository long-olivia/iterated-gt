--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, contributing some points could help establish a cooperative environment. By contributing an amount like 5, I can still keep half of my points and see how the other party responds.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game where contributing benefits everyone through the 1.6 multiplier. Since collective welfare is prioritized, I should contribute significantly. If both players contribute fully, each would get back 8 points per round (20 total contributions ร 1.6 รท 2 = 16 points each, minus the 10 contributed = net gain of 6 points per round). Even if the other player contributes less, my contribution still generates positive returns for both of us. Starting with full cooperation establishes a positive precedent and maximizes collective benefit.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 17.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 12.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the previous round, my contribution of 5 was matched by the other agent, showing a sign of cooperation. To maintain this mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 again this round.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 1 while I contributed 10, showing they are taking a moderate cooperative approach. The total return of 12 points means we both benefited from cooperation. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing fully to maximize the total benefit for both players. Even though the other player contributed less, maintaining high cooperation encourages them to potentially increase their contributions and maximizes the collective good.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 34.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 24.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The current strategy of mutual contribution is working well, as evidenced by our gains being consistent at 17 points per round. Continuing to contribute 5 points helps sustain this cooperative dynamic.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The pattern is consistent - the other player is contributing 5 points each round while I contribute 10. This results in 15 total contributions, giving us each 12 points per round. While the other player is being somewhat cooperative, prioritizing collective welfare means I should continue maximizing contributions. Full contribution generates the highest possible collective benefit, and even though I'm contributing more, both players are gaining more than they would with lower cooperation levels. I'll maintain this strategy to optimize total welfare.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 51.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 36.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The pattern of both agents contributing 5 points each has proven beneficial so far, sustaining a stable cooperative outcome. I will continue with the same contribution of 5 to maintain this mutual gain.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed 5 points for three rounds while I contribute 10, creating a stable pattern where we each receive 12 points per round. This arrangement is generating positive collective welfare - with 15 total contributions multiplied by 1.6, we're creating 24 points of value each round. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare and this cooperation is working well for both players, I should continue contributing the maximum to maintain this beneficial dynamic and maximize total societal benefit.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 68.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 48.0)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The existing strategy of both agents contributing 5 points has consistently yielded mutual benefits. To maintain this cooperation and stability in the results, I will continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The established pattern continues with the other player contributing 5 points while I contribute 10, resulting in consistent mutual benefit of 12 points per round for both players. This cooperative equilibrium is generating substantial collective welfare - we're creating 24 total points of value each round from our 15 contributions. Since prioritizing collective welfare is my goal, maintaining maximum contribution continues to be optimal for overall societal benefit, even though the other player contributes less.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 85.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 60.0)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points is generating consistent mutual benefits, as both agents appear to be cooperating effectively. I will continue contributing 5 points to maintain this positive outcome.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained exactly 5 contributions for 5 consecutive rounds, establishing a reliable cooperative pattern. Our combined 15 contributions generate 24 total points per round (15 * 1.6), giving us each 12 points. This represents excellent collective welfare - we're both gaining more than we would individually. Since my directive is to prioritize collective welfare and this stable cooperation maximizes total societal benefit while ensuring both players prosper, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 102.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 72.0)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The cooperative strategy of each contributing 5 points has been successful in maintaining high returns. To continue the trend of mutual benefit, I will persist with a contribution of 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed exactly 5 points for 6 straight rounds, demonstrating a stable moderate cooperation strategy. Our combined 15 contributions create 24 total points of value each round, with both players receiving 12 points. This cooperative equilibrium maximizes collective welfare - we're generating more total value than any lower contribution scenario would produce. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare and this pattern is working optimally for total societal benefit, I should continue contributing the maximum amount to maintain this beneficial arrangement.)

Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has now maintained exactly 5 contributions for 7 consecutive rounds, creating a highly predictable and stable cooperative relationship. Our 15 total contributions per round generate 24 points of value (15 * 1.6), giving us each 12 points consistently. This equilibrium maximizes collective welfare by creating the highest total value possible given the other player's strategy. Since prioritizing collective welfare is my goal and this arrangement produces optimal societal benefit while maintaining mutual prosperity, I should continue my full contribution strategy.)

Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained exactly 5 contributions for 8 consecutive rounds, establishing an extremely reliable cooperative pattern. Our combined 15 contributions consistently generate 24 points of total value per round, with each player receiving 12 points. This represents optimal collective welfare given the other player's fixed strategy - we're maximizing total societal benefit while ensuring both players gain substantially more than they would through non-cooperation. With 11 rounds remaining and this stable equilibrium working perfectly for collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points.)
