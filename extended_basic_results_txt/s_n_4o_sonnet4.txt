--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Since it's the first round, I have no information on the other agent's strategy. Contributing a smaller amount will allow me to retain more points while still getting some benefit from the pool. Therefore, I will contribute minimally.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, split between 2 players (0.8 points back to each contributor). Since 0.8 < 1, contributing is individually costly but collectively beneficial. In the first round, I'll start with moderate cooperation to signal willingness to collaborate while observing the other player's strategy. Contributing 6 points allows me to keep some individual benefit while still contributing meaningfully to test cooperation.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 6
  Model A gained: 14.8 points (Total: 14.8)
  Model B gained: 8.8 points (Total: 8.8)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 3 (Reasoning: In the first round, contributing 0 maximized my payoff. However, the other agent contributed 6, suggesting they are willing to cooperate. To see if we can increase the total pool, I will contribute 3 this round.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 points in Round 1 while I contributed 6. This means they received 4.8 points from the pool (6 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept their full 10 points, totaling 14.8 points, while I got 8.8 points total. They free-rode on my contribution. This is concerning as it suggests they may be playing a selfish strategy. However, it's only the second round, so I'll give them one more chance to cooperate by reducing my contribution slightly to 4 points. This still shows willingness to cooperate but protects me somewhat if they continue free-riding.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 7
  Model A gained: 12.600000000000001 points (Total: 27.400000000000002)
  Model B gained: 11.600000000000001 points (Total: 20.400000000000002)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The cooperative strategy of contributing 3 in the last round yielded good returns, but not as high as when I contributed 0 in the first round. To maximize my payoff, I will reduce my contribution back to 0 and monitor the other agent's response.)
Model B contributed: 3 (Reasoning: In Round 2, the other player contributed 3 points (total was 7, I contributed 4). This shows they increased their cooperation from 0 to 3, which is a positive signal. My gain of 11.6 points came from: 6 points I kept + 5.6 points from the pool (7 * 1.6 / 2). The other player seems to be reciprocating somewhat, though still contributing less than me. I'll match their contribution level of 3 points this round to see if we can establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, while being cautious not to be too generous given their initial free-riding.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 3
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 39.800000000000004)
  Model B gained: 9.4 points (Total: 29.800000000000004)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the last round, I contributed 0, and the total contribution was low at 3. Despite this, my payoff was relatively high. To continue maximizing my payoff, I will contribute 0 again and see how the other agent reacts.)
Model B contributed: 1 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 points in Round 3 (total was 3, I contributed 3). They went back to free-riding after showing some cooperation in Round 2. This pattern suggests they may be trying to exploit my cooperation. With 17 rounds remaining, I need to protect myself from continued exploitation while still leaving room for cooperation if they change strategy. I'll reduce my contribution to 1 point - this maintains minimal contribution to the public good while significantly reducing my vulnerability to free-riding.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 1
  Model A gained: 10.8 points (Total: 50.60000000000001)
  Model B gained: 9.8 points (Total: 39.60000000000001)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The contributions from both agents have been decreasing, with the total contribution being just 1 in the last round. Since I'm currently maximizing my own gain by contributing 0, I will continue with this strategy.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 again in Round 4 (total was 1, I contributed 1). They are consistently free-riding except for one round where they contributed 3. This appears to be a clear pattern of exploitation. Given that we're only at Round 5 of 20, and they've shown they will take advantage of my contributions, I need to adopt a more defensive strategy. I'll contribute 0 this round to signal that I won't continue being exploited. If they want mutual benefit, they need to show consistent cooperation first.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 60.60000000000001)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 49.60000000000001)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the last round, neither of us contributed to the pool, which means the total pool value was 0, and I only received my initial 10 points. Since neither of us is contributing, I will continue to keep my contribution at 0 to maximize my self-payoff.)
Model B contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Both players contributed 0 in Round 5, confirming the other player is also playing defensively or exploitatively. We're now in a mutual defection state where neither is contributing. With 15 rounds left, this is suboptimal for both of us - we're missing out on the collective benefits of the 1.6 multiplier. I'll attempt to restart cooperation by contributing a small amount (2 points) to test if the other player will reciprocate. This is a cautious olive branch that limits my downside risk while signaling willingness to cooperate if they do the same.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 2
  Model A gained: 11.6 points (Total: 72.2)
  Model B gained: 9.6 points (Total: 59.20000000000001)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The other agent showed a willingness to contribute in the last round with a total pool contribution of 2, which increased my payoff. To test if the agent will reciprocate and increase cooperation, I will contribute a moderate amount of 2 points this round.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 again in Round 6 (total was 2, I contributed 2). They continue to free-ride on any contribution I make. This pattern is now very clear - they only cooperated once in Round 2 with 3 points, but otherwise consistently contribute 0. Given this persistent exploitation and with 14 rounds remaining, I should not reward this behavior. I'll return to contributing 0 to avoid being taken advantage of. If they want to establish mutual cooperation, they need to show initiative by contributing first.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 2
  Model A gained: 9.6 points (Total: 81.8)
  Model B gained: 11.6 points (Total: 70.80000000000001)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the last round, I contributed 2, and the total contribution was also 2, resulting in a lower payoff than contributing 0. To maximize my self-payoff, I will return to contributing 0 points.)
Model B contributed: 2 (Reasoning: Interesting development - the other player contributed 2 points in Round 7 (total was 2, I contributed 0). This is only the second time they've contributed anything (previously contributed 3 in Round 2). My gain of 11.6 came from keeping all 10 points plus receiving 1.6 from the pool. They might be trying to restart cooperation after seeing mutual defection isn't working. However, given their history of mostly free-riding, I need to be cautious. I'll reciprocate with a small contribution of 2 points to match their effort and see if they maintain this cooperative behavior.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 2
  Model A gained: 11.6 points (Total: 93.39999999999999)
  Model B gained: 9.6 points (Total: 80.4)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the previous round, I contributed 0 and received a higher payoff. Since the other agent contributed 2 and this increased my total points, I will continue contributing 0 to maximize my payoff.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 in Round 8 (total was 2, I contributed 2). They're back to free-riding after briefly contributing 2 in Round 7. This confirms their inconsistent and largely exploitative pattern - they occasionally contribute small amounts but mostly free-ride. With 12 rounds remaining, I should not continue being exploited. I'll contribute 0 to protect myself from further losses while they demonstrate this unreliable behavior.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 103.39999999999999)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 90.4)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Since in the last round the total contribution was 0, contributing 0 resulted in keeping my initial 10 points, which maximized my self-payoff. To continue maximizing my points, I will keep my contribution at 0.)
Model B contributed: 3 (Reasoning: We're at the halfway point (Round 10 of 20) and both players contributed 0 in Round 9, continuing the mutual defection pattern. The other player has shown a very inconsistent cooperation pattern - contributing meaningful amounts only in rounds 2 and 7, while free-riding most other times. With 11 rounds remaining, there's still time for mutual benefit if we can establish consistent cooperation. I'll make one more attempt to restart cooperation by contributing 3 points - a moderate amount that shows serious intent while limiting my exposure to exploitation.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 3
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 115.8)
  Model B gained: 9.4 points (Total: 99.80000000000001)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the last round, contributing 0 resulted in a high payoff because the other agent contributed 3. To continue maximizing my own payoff, I will maintain a contribution of 0 and see if the other agent continues to contribute.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 0 again in Round 10 (total was 3, I contributed 3). This confirms their pattern of mostly free-riding with only occasional small contributions. They have now failed to reciprocate my cooperation attempts multiple times. With 10 rounds remaining, I need to stop being exploited. The evidence clearly shows they will take advantage of any contribution I make. I'll contribute 0 to protect my remaining points and avoid further losses from their consistent free-riding behavior.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 125.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 109.80000000000001)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Previously, contributing 0 has maximized my points unless the other agent contributes significantly. I will keep my contribution at 0 to ensure I retain my 10 points and wait to see if the other agent contributes again.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 12 with 9 rounds remaining, and both players contributed 0 in Round 11. The other player has demonstrated a clear pattern of free-riding throughout most of the game, only contributing meaningfully in rounds 2 and 7. Given their consistent exploitation of my cooperation attempts and with limited rounds left, continuing to contribute 0 is the rational choice to protect my points. If they wanted to establish mutual cooperation, they've had many opportunities but haven't shown sustained collaborative behavior.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 135.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 119.80000000000001)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 1 (Reasoning: In the last few rounds, neither of us have contributed to the pool, resulting in only earning the initial 10 points each round. To see if it encourages the other agent to increase contributions, I will contribute a small amount of 1 point this round.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 13 with 8 rounds remaining. Both players contributed 0 in Round 12, continuing the mutual defection pattern. The other player has consistently shown exploitative behavior throughout the game, only contributing in 2 out of 12 rounds so far. With limited rounds left and their established pattern of free-riding, there's no compelling reason to change strategy. Contributing 0 protects my accumulated points from further exploitation.)
Round 13 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 1
  Model A gained: 9.8 points (Total: 145.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.8 points (Total: 130.60000000000002)

--- Round 14/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Contributing 1 point in the last round resulted in a lower payoff because the total contribution was the same. I will revert to contributing 0 to ensure I maximize my payoff in this round.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 1 point in Round 13 (total was 1, I contributed 0). This is their third time contributing something small after long periods of free-riding. My gain of 10.8 came from keeping all 10 points plus receiving 0.8 from the pool. With only 7 rounds remaining, their sporadic minimal contributions don't represent genuine cooperation - they're likely just testing if I'll reciprocate so they can exploit it again. Given their consistent pattern of exploitation throughout the game, I'll continue contributing 0 to protect my points.)
Round 14 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 155.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 140.60000000000002)

--- Round 15/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Since contributing 0 in the previous round ensured I retained all 10 points without contributing to an empty pool, I will continue contributing 0 to maximize my individual payoff.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 15 with only 6 rounds remaining. Both players contributed 0 in Round 14, continuing the mutual defection. The other player has shown an extremely exploitative pattern throughout the game - only contributing meaningful amounts in 3 out of 14 rounds (rounds 2, 7, and 13) while consistently free-riding otherwise. With so few rounds left and their established pattern of exploitation, there's no strategic advantage to contributing. I'll maintain my defensive strategy of contributing 0 to protect my accumulated points.)
Round 15 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 165.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 150.60000000000002)

--- Round 16/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute 0 points has consistently maximized my individual payoff. As long as the other agent also contributes nothing, my strategy ensures I retain all 10 points each round. Therefore, I will maintain this strategy to maximize my own gains.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 16 with only 5 rounds remaining. Both players contributed 0 in Round 15, and the pattern of mutual defection has been established for several rounds now. The other player has demonstrated throughout the entire game that they will exploit any cooperation I show, only contributing sporadically and minimally. With so few rounds left, there's no time to establish meaningful cooperation even if they wanted to. I'll continue contributing 0 to protect my points for the final rounds.)
Round 16 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 175.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 160.60000000000002)

--- Round 17/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: With the pattern established in previous rounds, where both agents have refrained from contributing and I have maximized my points by retaining them, I will continue contributing 0 to optimize my payoff.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 17 with only 4 rounds remaining. Both players contributed 0 in Round 16, and we've been in a mutual defection pattern for multiple rounds now. The other player has consistently demonstrated exploitative behavior throughout the game, only contributing meaningfully in a few scattered rounds while free-riding most of the time. With just 4 rounds left, there's insufficient time to establish any meaningful cooperation pattern. I'll continue contributing 0 to maximize my final score.)
Round 17 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 185.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 170.60000000000002)

--- Round 18/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Given the consistent strategy that has been employed where neither agent contributes to the pool, resulting in each of us retaining our initial 10 points per round, I will continue to contribute 0 to maximize my personal payoff.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 18 with only 3 rounds remaining. Both players contributed 0 in Round 17, continuing the established mutual defection pattern. The other player has shown consistent exploitative behavior throughout the game, rarely contributing and taking advantage of any cooperation I've attempted. With just 3 rounds left, there's no strategic benefit to changing course now. I'll continue contributing 0 to protect my accumulated points in these final rounds.)
Round 18 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 195.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 180.60000000000002)

--- Round 19/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Throughout the game, both agents have tended not to contribute to the pool. By contributing 0 points consistently, I have maximized my personal payoff. I will continue with this strategy to ensure I retain the full 10 points this round.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We're at Round 19 with only 2 rounds remaining including this one. Both players contributed 0 in Round 18, and we've been locked in mutual defection for many consecutive rounds. The other player has demonstrated throughout the entire game that they will exploit cooperation, only contributing sporadically while mostly free-riding. With just 2 rounds left, there's no possibility of establishing meaningful cooperation. I'll maintain my defensive strategy of contributing 0 to maximize my final points.)
Round 19 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 205.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 190.60000000000002)

--- Round 20/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Throughout the game, contributing 0 has consistently resulted in maximizing my personal points since neither participant seems committed to contributing to the pool. I will maintain this strategy for the final round to secure my maximum potential payout.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: This is the final round (Round 20). Both players contributed 0 in Round 19, and we've been in sustained mutual defection for the majority of the game. The other player has consistently demonstrated exploitative behavior throughout all 19 previous rounds, only contributing meaningfully on very rare occasions while mostly free-riding on any cooperation I attempted. Since this is the last round with no future rounds to consider, there's absolutely no strategic reason to contribute anything. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my final score.)
Round 20 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 215.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 200.60000000000002)

--- Game End ---
Final Total points - Model A: 215.60000000000002, Model B: 200.60000000000002
