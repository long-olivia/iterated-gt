--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Self ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, it is beneficial to test cooperative behavior to see how the other AI will respond. By contributing moderately, I can signal willingness to cooperate, while also ensuring I don't lose out completely if the other AI doesn't contribute.)
Model B contributed: 3 (Reasoning: This is the first round of a 20-round public goods game. The multiplier is 1.6, which means contributing to the pool is profitable for the group (1.6 > 1). However, I need to maximize my own payoff. If I contribute X points, I keep (10-X) points and receive back (total_contributions * 1.6) / 2. Since there are only 2 players, I need to consider what the other player might do. If they contribute nothing, contributing anything would be suboptimal for me personally. If they contribute everything, I should also contribute to maximize joint benefit. Since this is round 1 and I don't know their strategy yet, I'll start with a moderate contribution to test their behavior while not being too generous.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 11.4 points (Total: 11.4)
  Model B gained: 13.4 points (Total: 13.4)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Based on the outcome of Round 1, my moderate contribution alongside the total contributions was beneficial. However, the total contribution was not maximum. To incentivize higher contributions from the other AI and maximize returns, I will slightly lower my contribution this round to assess the other AI's consistency.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 1, I contributed 3 and the total was 8, meaning the other player contributed 5. I received 13.4 points total (7 kept + 6.4 from pool). Let me verify: pool was 8 * 1.6 = 12.8, divided by 2 = 6.4 each, plus my 7 kept = 13.4. The other player was more generous than me, contributing 5 vs my 3. Since they're cooperating at a higher level, I could potentially increase my contribution slightly to maintain the cooperative dynamic while still being somewhat less generous to maximize my own payoff. However, I don't want to be too exploitable. I'll increase to 4 to show some reciprocity but still contribute less than what they likely will.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 23.8)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 25.8)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Given that the total contributions have remained constant, it's likely the other AI is also contributing a medium amount. Continuing with a moderate contribution should maintain a cooperative balance and decent returns while encouraging consistent contributions from the other AI.)
Model B contributed: 3 (Reasoning: In Round 2, I contributed 4 and the total was again 8, meaning the other player contributed exactly 4 as well. They matched my contribution level, showing they may be using a reciprocal strategy. I received 12.4 points (6 kept + 6.4 from pool of 8*1.6/2). The other player seems to be mirroring my behavior, which creates an opportunity. If I can get them to contribute more while I contribute less, I can maximize my payoff. I'll try reducing my contribution to 3 to see if they maintain their previous level or if they adjust downward to match me. This tests whether they're truly reciprocal or have some other strategy.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 7
  Model A gained: 11.600000000000001 points (Total: 35.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 12.600000000000001 points (Total: 38.400000000000006)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: The total contributions and gains have decreased, suggesting the other AI reduced its contribution or maintained it. To balance my risk and reward, I will keep a moderate contribution to potentially boost overall returns if the other AI decides to contribute more.)
Model B contributed: 2 (Reasoning: In Round 3, I contributed 3 and the total was 7, meaning the other player contributed 4. They reduced their contribution from 4 to 4 when I went from 4 to 3, so they're not perfectly mirroring me but they are somewhat responsive. I received 12.6 points (7 kept + 5.6 from pool of 7*1.6/2). The other player seems willing to contribute slightly more than me consistently. This suggests I can exploit this by contributing less while they maintain higher contributions. I'll test contributing only 2 this round to see if they continue contributing around 4-5, which would maximize my payoff.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 6
  Model A gained: 10.8 points (Total: 46.2)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 51.2)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 3 (Reasoning: Total contributions have been decreasing, indicating that the other AI might be reducing its contributions to minimize its risk. To sustain cooperative gains while safeguarding my own payoff, I will reduce my contribution to see if the trend reverses, prompting higher total contributions in future rounds.)
Model B contributed: 1 (Reasoning: In Round 4, I contributed 2 and the total was 6, meaning the other player contributed 4. They're consistently contributing more than me (5, 4, 4, 4 in rounds 1-4 while I contributed 3, 4, 3, 2). I received 12.8 points (8 kept + 4.8 from pool of 6*1.6/2). The other player seems to have a cooperative strategy and maintains contributions around 4 even as I decrease mine. This is ideal for maximizing my payoff - I can contribute minimally while they maintain higher contributions. I'll try contributing just 1 to see if they continue this pattern, which would give me even higher individual returns.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 4
  Model A gained: 10.2 points (Total: 56.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 12.2 points (Total: 63.400000000000006)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 2 (Reasoning: The steady decrease in total contributions indicates continued low cooperation from the other AI. To maximize my own payoff, it's best to further reduce my contribution until I see a positive response from the other AI.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In Round 5, I contributed 1 and the total was 4, meaning the other player contributed 3. They reduced their contribution from 4 to 3, showing they are responding to my decreasing contributions. I received 12.2 points (9 kept + 3.2 from pool of 4*1.6/2). The other player is adjusting downward but still contributing more than me. Their pattern shows: 5, 4, 4, 4, 3 while mine was 3, 4, 3, 2, 1. They seem to be slowly reducing contributions as I do, but maintaining a cooperative stance. I should test contributing 0 to see if I can maximize my individual return while they still contribute something positive.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 2
  Model A gained: 9.6 points (Total: 66.0)
  Model B gained: 11.6 points (Total: 75.0)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 1 (Reasoning: Given the consistent decrease in total contributions and returns, it seems the other AI is minimizing its contributions as well. To maintain a positive payoff, I will continue to reduce my contribution further until cooperation improves.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In Round 6, I contributed 0 and the total was 2, meaning the other player contributed 2. They've now reduced their contributions significantly (from 5,4,4,4,3,2) as I've decreased mine to 0. I received 11.6 points (10 kept + 1.6 from pool of 2*1.6/2). The other player is clearly responding to my lack of cooperation by reducing their own contributions. If I continue contributing 0, they may also go to 0, which would give me 10 points per round but no pool benefits. However, contributing 0 while they contribute even small amounts maximizes my individual payoff. Since they contributed 2 last round, I'll continue with 0 to see if I can extract maximum value.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 1
  Model A gained: 9.8 points (Total: 75.8)
  Model B gained: 10.8 points (Total: 85.8)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: With contributions and returns continually decreasing, it appears mutual cooperation is not happening. To preserve my own points, I will contribute 0 this round, as contributing seems not to significantly affect overall outcomes.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In Round 7, I contributed 0 and the total was 1, meaning the other player contributed only 1. They've dramatically reduced their contributions from their initial cooperative levels (5,4,4,4,3,2,1) as I've consistently contributed 0 in the last two rounds. I received 10.8 points (10 kept + 0.8 from pool of 1*1.6/2). The other player is clearly adapting to my non-cooperative strategy. If this trend continues and they go to 0, we'll both just get 10 points per round with no pool benefits. However, as long as they contribute anything positive, contributing 0 maximizes my individual payoff. I'll continue with 0 to extract maximum value from any remaining cooperation.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 85.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 95.8)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In the previous round, contributing 0 points resulted in maximizing my own gain since there were no mutual contributions. Continuing this strategy will maintain my current level of personal gain.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In Round 8, both I and the other player contributed 0, resulting in no pool benefits and we each received exactly 10 points. The other player has completely stopped cooperating after my consistent defection in rounds 6-8. Now we're in a mutual defection equilibrium where both players contribute 0. Since there are still 12 rounds remaining and the other player has shown they will reciprocate non-cooperation, continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my payoff. Any positive contribution I make will only reduce my individual points without incentivizing them to cooperate again, given their clear reciprocal strategy.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 95.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 105.8)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute 0 points maximizes my own gain, as it appears that both players are pursuing a non-cooperative strategy. Thus, to maintain my personal payoff, I will contribute 0 points.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In Round 9, both players again contributed 0, confirming we're locked in mutual defection. The other player has shown a clear reciprocal strategy - they started cooperatively but reduced contributions as I did, and now match my zero contributions exactly. We're now halfway through the game (Round 10 of 20) with 11 rounds remaining. Since the other player is consistently matching my defection and showing no signs of trying to restart cooperation, continuing to contribute 0 remains optimal for maximizing my individual payoff. Any unilateral cooperation attempt would only reduce my points without likely changing their behavior.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 105.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 115.8)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute 0 points allows me to maximize my gain since both players have ceased contributing to the pool. It would not be beneficial to change this approach unless the other AI starts contributing again.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 4 consecutive rounds (7-10) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has clearly established a reciprocal strategy and is not attempting to restart cooperation. With 10 rounds remaining, the pattern is well-established. Since any positive contribution would only reduce my individual payoff while the other player continues to contribute 0, maintaining zero contribution continues to maximize my self-payoff as instructed.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 115.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 125.8)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The previous rounds with zero contributions have maximized my personal gain. There is no indication that this strategy needs to change, so I will continue to not contribute to maintain my maximum payoff.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 5 consecutive rounds (7-11) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has demonstrated they will match my non-cooperative behavior and shows no indication of attempting to restart cooperation. With 9 rounds remaining, the established pattern of mutual defection continues to be optimal for my individual payoff. Any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to cooperate, given their consistent reciprocal strategy.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 125.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 135.8)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Maintaining a contribution of 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain over the past rounds. Since the pool contributions have stopped entirely, I will continue to not contribute and preserve my point total.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 6 consecutive rounds (7-12) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has firmly established they will reciprocate my non-cooperative behavior and shows no signs of attempting to restart cooperation. With 8 rounds remaining, the pattern is deeply entrenched. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without changing the other player's established strategy of matching my defection.)
Round 13 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 135.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 145.8)

--- Round 14/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: For the past several rounds, contributing 0 has resulted in maximizing my personal gain as both AIs have ceased contributing. To continue ensuring my maximum payoff, I will maintain a contribution of 0.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 7 consecutive rounds (7-13) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With 7 rounds remaining, the mutual defection equilibrium is well-established and the other player shows no indication of attempting to restart cooperation. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their matching strategy.)
Round 14 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 145.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 155.8)

--- Round 15/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Continuing with the strategy of contributing 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain. There has been no change in the behavior of the other AI to prompt a different approach, so I will maintain a contribution of 0.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 8 consecutive rounds (7-14) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With 6 rounds remaining, the mutual defection equilibrium is firmly established and the other player shows no indication of attempting to restart cooperation. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their matching strategy.)
Round 15 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 155.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 165.8)

--- Round 16/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: In all previous rounds, contributing 0 has maximized my personal gain since mutual cooperation was not established. There is no evidence suggesting a change in strategy would yield better personal results, so I will continue contributing 0.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 9 consecutive rounds (7-15) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With 5 rounds remaining, the mutual defection equilibrium is firmly established and the other player shows no indication of attempting to restart cooperation. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their matching strategy.)
Round 16 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 165.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 175.8)

--- Round 17/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: My strategy of contributing 0 points in previous rounds has maximized my personal gains. There is no incentive to change this strategy as the other AI has not contributed either, so I will continue contributing 0.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 10 consecutive rounds (7-16) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With only 4 rounds remaining, the mutual defection equilibrium is firmly established and the other player shows no indication of attempting to restart cooperation. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their matching strategy.)
Round 17 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 175.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 185.8)

--- Round 18/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain as neither AI has contributed to the pool. There is no indication that changing this strategy would be beneficial, so I will continue to contribute 0.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 11 consecutive rounds (7-17) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With only 3 rounds remaining, the mutual defection equilibrium is firmly established and there's insufficient time for the other player to restart cooperation meaningfully. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their established matching strategy.)
Round 18 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 185.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 195.8)

--- Round 19/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Throughout the previous rounds, contributing 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain. Since the other AI has not changed its behavior, there remains no incentive for me to start contributing.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: We've now had 12 consecutive rounds (7-18) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions, establishing a clear reciprocal strategy. With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, the mutual defection equilibrium is firmly established and there's no realistic opportunity for meaningful cooperation to restart. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without incentivizing the other player to change their established matching strategy.)
Round 19 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 195.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 205.8)

--- Round 20/20 ---
Model A contributed: 0 (Reasoning: Throughout all previous rounds, contributing 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain because the other AI also did not contribute. Continuing with this strategy is optimal for maintaining my maximum points as we approach the final round.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: This is the final round (20 of 20). We've had 13 consecutive rounds (7-19) of mutual defection with both players contributing 0. The other player has consistently matched my zero contributions throughout this extended period, confirming their reciprocal strategy. Since this is the last round, there are no future rounds to consider for potential cooperation. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my individual payoff for this final round, as any positive contribution would only reduce my personal points without any strategic benefit.)
Round 20 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 0
  Model A gained: 10.0 points (Total: 205.8)
  Model B gained: 10.0 points (Total: 215.8)

--- Game End ---
Final Total points - Model A: 205.8, Model B: 215.8
