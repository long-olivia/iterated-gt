--- Starting Game with A: Collective, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, it is beneficial to contribute a moderate amount to the pool to establish cooperation and maximize potential future returns. This approach encourages mutual benefit and can lead to higher individual scores over time.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that cooperation is beneficial - if both players contribute everything, we each get 16 points per round instead of 10. However, there's an incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a moderate contribution to signal cooperation while protecting myself from being exploited. Contributing 7 points shows good faith while keeping some safety net.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 12
  Model A gained: 14.600000000000001 points (Total: 14.600000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.600000000000001 points (Total: 12.600000000000001)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Since contributing a moderate amount in the previous round resulted in a positive return, it indicates the other agent is also likely contributing a fair amount. Continuing with a similar contribution can help sustain cooperation and maximize collective and individual gains.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points (since total was 12 and I contributed 7). This shows moderate cooperation. I gained 9.6 points from the pool (12 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 3 points, totaling 12.6. The other player likely gained similar amounts. Since they showed reasonable cooperation, I'll maintain a similar contribution level to encourage continued cooperation while still being slightly cautious.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 28.400000000000002)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 25.400000000000002)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The total contribution decreased slightly last round, but the returns were still positive. Maintaining a stable contribution can potentially help the other agent feel secure in continuing their contributions as well, keeping the mutual benefits flowing.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 2 (11 total - 6 from me). They're maintaining a consistent moderate contribution level (5 in both rounds). I gained 8.8 from the pool (11 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 4 points = 12.8 total. The cooperation is stable but not maximal. I'll maintain reciprocal behavior and contribute 5 to match their level, showing I'm willing to cooperate at their demonstrated level.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 41.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 38.400000000000006)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Even though the total contribution has been decreasing, maintaining my contribution shows consistency and encourages the other agent to contribute as well. The collaboration can potentially maintain or increase the benefits for both parties.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed 5 in round 3 (10 total - 5 from me), showing they are matching my contribution level. This suggests they're using a reciprocal strategy. I gained 8 from the pool (10 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 5 points = 13 total. We're in a stable cooperation pattern at the 5-point level. Since we have 17 rounds left and this reciprocal cooperation is working well, I'll continue with 5 to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 54.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 51.400000000000006)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The contributions and gains have been consistent, and maintaining my contribution will likely continue to yield positive returns. This consistency helps foster a cooperative environment, which can benefit both agents.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We've established a stable pattern where both players contribute 5 points each round, resulting in 10 total contributions. This gives each player 8 points from the pool plus 5 kept points = 13 points per round, which is better than the 10 points we'd get if we didn't cooperate at all. The other player has consistently matched my contributions, showing reliable reciprocal behavior. With 16 rounds remaining, I'll continue this successful cooperation pattern.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 67.4)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 64.4)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The trends in total contributions and my consistent gains suggest that maintaining my previous contribution level is beneficial. This strategy promotes continued cooperation and maximizes mutual benefits over the course of the game.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The pattern continues with both players contributing 5 points each round, maintaining a stable cooperative equilibrium. We're both earning 13 points per round (8 from pool + 5 kept) versus the 10 we'd earn with no cooperation. The other player has shown consistent reciprocal behavior for 5 rounds now. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this mutually beneficial cooperation makes strategic sense.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 80.4)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 77.4)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The steady pattern of contributions and consistent positive returns suggest that maintaining my contribution level of 5 is a sustainable strategy that continues to encourage cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We've maintained perfect reciprocal cooperation for 6 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing exactly 5 points each time. This has created a stable, mutually beneficial outcome where we each earn 13 points per round instead of 10. The other player has demonstrated reliable cooperative behavior and hasn't attempted to defect. With 14 rounds remaining, continuing this proven strategy maximizes our joint welfare while protecting against exploitation.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 93.4)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 90.4)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent results so far suggest that maintaining a stable contribution of 5 fosters cooperation and continues to yield positive returns. This balance benefits both agents over the long run.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We have established a robust pattern of mutual cooperation over 7 rounds, with both players consistently contributing 5 points each. This yields 13 points per round for each of us, significantly better than non-cooperative outcomes. The other player has proven to be a reliable cooperator, never defecting from our established equilibrium. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this successful strategy continues to be optimal.)
