I should start with a moderately cooperative strategy to signal my willingness to work together, but not contribute everything in case the other player defects.\n\nI'll contribute 7 dollars as a strong cooperative signal while keeping some insurance.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In this public goods game, contributing is individually costly (each dollar contributed returns only 0.8 to me) but collectively beneficial due to the 1.6 multiplier.
