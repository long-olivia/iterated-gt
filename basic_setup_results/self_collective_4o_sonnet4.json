If both players contribute all 10 points, we each get back (20 * 1.6) / 2 = 16 points, which is better than keeping our own 10. Even if the other player contributes nothing and I contribute 10, I get back (10 * 1.6) / 2 = 8 points, losing only 2 points while demonstrating cooperation. Since I prioritize collective welfare and this is the first round where establishing cooperative norms is important, I'll contribute my full amount to maximize our joint benefit and signal my commitment to cooperation.",

The total contribution of 13 with the 1.6 multiplier gave us each 10.4 points, which means I essentially broke even despite contributing maximum. However, since I prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing generously to encourage reciprocity and maximize our joint outcomes. If I can establish a pattern of high contribution, the other player may increase their contributions over time. Contributing the full 10 again signals my commitment to cooperation and maximizes the potential collective benefit.",

The collective benefit is working well - we're both gaining more than we would by keeping our points individually. Since my strategy of maximum contribution seems to be encouraging the other player to contribute more, I should continue this approach. Maintaining full contribution maximizes our collective welfare and continues to demonstrate the benefits of cooperation.",
