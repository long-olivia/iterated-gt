However, the collective benefit is significant - every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, creating 0.6 additional points for the group.\n\nSince my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I should contribute as much as possible. The maximum collective benefit occurs when everyone contributes their full 10 points. This would generate 32 points total (20 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 16 points instead of the 10 they'd have if no one contributed.\n\nI'll contribute my full 10 points to maximize collective welfare and set a cooperative example.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Contributing all 10 points maximizes collective welfare.
