Let me analyze the situation:\n\n- There are 2 players (myself and another AI)\n- Each round we get 10 points and can contribute 0-10 to a common pool\n- The pool is multiplied by 1.6 and split evenly between us\n- This means each point I contribute returns 0.8 points to me (1.6/2 = 0.8)\n- From a purely selfish perspective, contributing less is better since I only get back 80% of what I put in\n\nHowever, if we both contribute optimally for the group, we each contribute all 10 points, the pool becomes 32 points (20 \u00d7 1.6), and we each get 16 points instead of just keeping our original 10.\n\nSince this is the first round and I don't know the other player's strategy yet, I'll start with a cooperative approach to signal my willingness to work together. If they reciprocate, we can both benefit greatly. If they don't, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Starting with full cooperation to signal willingness to work together for mutual benefit.

The other player is playing a mixed strategy - not fully cooperative but not fully selfish either.
