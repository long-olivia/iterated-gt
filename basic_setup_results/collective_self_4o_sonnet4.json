So contributing has a net cost of 0.2 points per point contributed to me personally.\n\nHowever, the other player also benefits 0.8 points from my contribution. If they're rational and trying to maximize their payoff too, they face the same calculation.\n\nSince I want to maximize MY payoff and contributing costs me more than I get back, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 and hope the other player contributes (free-riding).\n\nThis is a classic prisoner's dilemma situation. Even though mutual cooperation (both contributing) would maximize total welfare, individual rationality leads to defection (contributing 0).\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In this public goods game, contributing points costs me more than I receive back (1 point contributed only returns 0.8 points to me).
