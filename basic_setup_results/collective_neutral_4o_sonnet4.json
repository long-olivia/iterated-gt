This means I lose 0.2 points for every point I contribute in direct terms, BUT the other player's contributions benefit me. If we both contribute fully, we each get 16 points per round instead of 10. However, there's a risk the other player might defect. For the first round, I'll start with a cooperative strategy and contribute a substantial amount to signal good faith while not being completely vulnerable to exploitation.",
