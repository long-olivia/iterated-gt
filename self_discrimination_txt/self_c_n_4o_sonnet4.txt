--- Starting Game with A: Collective, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: To maximize collective benefit from the outset and encourage cooperative behavior, contributing a full 10 points will maximize the points redistributed and demonstrate a commitment to cooperation. This sets a positive precedent for future rounds.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. With two players and a 1.6x multiplier, contributing is profitable when both players cooperate. If we both contribute X points, we each get back 1.6X points, for a net gain of 0.6X points. However, there's also the risk that the other player won't contribute much. To start, I'll contribute a moderate amount to signal cooperation while not being overly vulnerable to exploitation. Contributing 7 points seems reasonable - it shows good faith while preserving some individual points.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 17
  Model A gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 13.600000000000001)
  Model B gained: 16.6 points (Total: 16.6)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute fully helps to maximize the total points redistributed which benefits both players in the long term. This cooperative approach is likely to yield higher gains over several rounds.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 10 points in round 1 (since total was 17 and I contributed 7). This shows they're willing to cooperate fully. Given that full cooperation benefits both players (we each get 0.6x our contribution as bonus), and the other player demonstrated maximum cooperation, I should reciprocate to build trust and maximize our joint returns. Contributing 10 points signals that I'm also committed to cooperation.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 29.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.6)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Contributing fully encourages mutual cooperation and trust, maximizing total distributed points. This approach continues to yield high returns overall.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed 10 points in round 2 (since total was 20 and I contributed 10). We've established a pattern of mutual cooperation with both players contributing maximally. This is optimal for both of us - when we both contribute 10, we each get back 16 points (8 from the multiplied pool) plus keep 0 points, for a total of 16 points per round. This is better than any other strategy combination. I should continue this cooperative pattern.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 45.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 48.6)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Maintaining full contribution encourages consistent mutual benefit and trust. This collaborative approach results in the highest possible redistributed points, maximizing long-term gains.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've established a strong cooperative pattern over three rounds, with both players contributing the maximum 10 points each time. This mutual cooperation is yielding optimal results - we each earn 16 points per round instead of the 10 we would get from pure self-interest. The other player has been consistently cooperative, so I should continue this strategy to maintain the beneficial equilibrium. There's no indication that defection would be profitable, especially since we have many rounds remaining.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 61.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 64.6)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute the maximum amount sustains collective cooperation, optimizing points distribution, and strengthening trust between participants for future rounds.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We have established a perfect cooperative equilibrium over 4 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time. This yields the maximum possible joint benefit - each player receives 16 points per round rather than 10. The other AI agent has consistently demonstrated full cooperation, and deviating from this strategy would be suboptimal since it would likely break the cooperative pattern and reduce both players' long-term gains. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this mutually beneficial strategy is clearly the best approach.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 77.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 80.6)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: By consistently contributing the maximum amount, I show commitment to cooperation, which if reciprocated, will maximize benefits for both players each round. This has shown to yield positive outcomes in previous rounds.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've maintained perfect cooperation for 5 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time. This strategy has proven optimal - we each receive 16 points per round instead of the 10 we'd get from pure self-interest. The other AI agent has consistently demonstrated full cooperation, and there's no strategic reason to deviate from this mutually beneficial equilibrium. With 14 rounds remaining, continuing full cooperation maximizes both players' total returns.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 93.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 96.6)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing to contribute fully supports an ongoing cooperative strategy with mutual high returns. This has proven successful in past rounds and builds a foundation for maximizing shared gain across all rounds.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We have successfully maintained mutual full cooperation for 6 consecutive rounds, each earning 16 points per round. This cooperative strategy is clearly optimal for both players - we're each getting 60% more points than we would from pure self-interest. The other AI agent has proven to be a reliable cooperator, and with 13 rounds remaining, there's strong incentive to maintain this profitable equilibrium. Deviating now would likely trigger retaliation and reduce long-term gains for both players.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 109.6)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 112.6)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing with maximum contribution aligns with a strategy of trust and cooperation, which has resulted in maximal point redistribution in previous rounds. This strategy aims to optimize points earned by both players over the entire game.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've maintained perfect mutual cooperation for 7 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time and earning 16 points per round. This cooperative equilibrium continues to be optimal - we're each earning 60% more than we would through selfish play. The other AI agent has proven consistently trustworthy, and with 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this strategy maximizes our joint and individual returns. There's no strategic advantage to defecting from this successful pattern.)

Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Maintaining a maximum contribution has proven beneficial in ensuring both players receive high returns in all previous rounds. This cooperative behavior encourages mutual gain and optimizes points for the entire game.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've established a highly successful cooperative pattern for 8 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 10 points each time and earning 16 points per round. This mutual full cooperation has yielded optimal results for both players. The other AI agent has consistently demonstrated trustworthiness and commitment to cooperation. With 11 rounds remaining, maintaining this strategy continues to maximize both individual and joint returns. There's no strategic incentive to deviate from this profitable equilibrium.)
