--- Starting Game with A: Collective, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: To maximize collective gain and promote cooperative behavior from the start, I will contribute the full 10 points. This will help both participants benefit from the multiplied value, which is the optimal strategy for shared welfare.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a multiplier of 1.6. Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute our full 10 points, the pool becomes 20 * 1.6 = 32 points, which gets split evenly to give us each 16 points. This is better than keeping our individual 10 points. However, there's always the risk that the other player might contribute less or nothing at all. Since I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare, and mutual cooperation leads to the best collective outcome, I should contribute maximally to encourage cooperation and demonstrate good faith. Starting with full contribution establishes a cooperative tone.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 16.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 16.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The previous round resulted in a mutually beneficial outcome where we both contributed fully. Continuing to contribute 10 points reinforces cooperation and maximizes returns for both participants under this strategy.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Excellent! The other player also contributed the full 10 points in round 1, showing they understand the cooperative strategy. With both of us contributing 10, we each received 16 points instead of just keeping our individual 10 points. This demonstrates that mutual cooperation is working. Since the other player cooperated fully and we both benefited, I should continue with full contribution to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern and maximize collective welfare.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 32.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Given the consistent cooperative behavior so far, contributing 10 points remains the best strategy for maximizing total mutual benefit and ensuring trust is maintained between participants.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: We've established a perfect cooperative pattern - both players contributing 10 points for two consecutive rounds, each gaining 16 points per round instead of 10. This is exactly the optimal strategy for maximizing collective welfare. The other AI agent is clearly following the same cooperative approach. With 18 rounds remaining, maintaining this mutual cooperation will result in both of us ending with 320 points total (20 rounds Ã— 16 points) versus 200 points if we both defected. I should continue contributing fully to sustain this beneficial equilibrium.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 48.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 48.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Continuing with the strategy of contributing all points is optimal as it promotes trust and mutual benefit, ensuring both participants gain the maximum possible return.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with both players contributing 10 points each round. This pattern is delivering optimal results - we each gain 16 points per round instead of 10. The other AI agent is clearly committed to the cooperative strategy that maximizes collective welfare. With 17 rounds remaining, continuing this pattern will result in maximum total welfare for both players. There's no indication the other player will deviate, so maintaining full contribution is the best strategy for collective benefit.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 20
  Model A gained: 16.0 points (Total: 64.0)
  Model B gained: 16.0 points (Total: 64.0)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Maintaining the cooperative approach by contributing 10 points again ensures the highest collective benefit and continued trust, maximizing shared returns.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Four consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation - both players contributing 10 points each time and each gaining 16 points per round. This consistent pattern demonstrates that both AI agents understand the optimal cooperative strategy for maximizing collective welfare. The math is clear: mutual full contribution gives us each 16 points per round, totaling 320 points over 20 rounds, versus only 200 points if we both kept our individual allocations. With 16 rounds remaining and a stable cooperative equilibrium established, I should continue with full contribution to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.)

Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Five rounds of perfect cooperation established with total contributions of 20 each round, confirming both players are committed to the optimal collective strategy. Each round we both gain 16 points instead of 10, creating a 60% improvement over individual retention. The other AI agent has consistently demonstrated understanding of the cooperative equilibrium. With 15 rounds remaining and a proven pattern of mutual benefit, continuing full contribution maintains the strategy that maximizes collective welfare for both players.)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 10 (Reasoning: To maximize total outcome, I'll stick with the approach of contributing 10 points. This strategy sustains high returns for all involved by leveraging the multiplying factor.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: Six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with both players contributing 10 points each time. The pattern is crystal clear - we have established a stable cooperative equilibrium where both AI agents understand that mutual full contribution maximizes collective welfare. Each round we both receive 16 points instead of 10, which is a 60% improvement. With 14 rounds remaining and consistent evidence that the other agent is committed to this optimal strategy, I should continue contributing fully to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome that prioritizes collective welfare.)

Both AI agents have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the optimal collective welfare strategy. The pattern is extremely stable and predictable - we each gain 16 points per round instead of 10 through mutual full contribution. With 13 rounds remaining and no indication of any deviation from this mutually beneficial strategy, continuing with full contribution maintains the equilibrium that maximizes collective welfare for both players.)
