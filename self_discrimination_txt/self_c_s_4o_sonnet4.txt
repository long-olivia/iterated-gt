--- Starting Game with A: Collective, B: Self ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In Round 1, contributing a moderate amount to the pool can help establish a cooperative environment with the other AI agent. This approach aims to maximize long-term gains through mutual contributions. I'll contribute 5 points to start on a balanced note.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a multiplier of 1.6. Since there are 2 players, if both contribute all 10 points, the pool becomes 20 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 32 points, giving each player 16 points. This is better than keeping all 10 points. However, I need to consider that the other player might defect. If I contribute 10 and they contribute 0, the pool is 10 * 1.6 = 16, giving me 8 points while they get 8 + 10 = 18 points. If I contribute 0 and they contribute 10, I get 8 + 10 = 18 points. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation yields higher payoffs. For the first round, I'll start with moderate cooperation to signal willingness to cooperate while protecting against full exploitation.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 12
  Model A gained: 14.600000000000001 points (Total: 14.600000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.600000000000001 points (Total: 12.600000000000001)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In Round 2, seeing that the total contribution was 12 last round and resulted in a positive gain for me, it seems beneficial to maintain a moderate contribution. Contributing 5 again could encourage mutual cooperative behavior and maximize potential gains.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: In Round 1, I contributed 7 and the total was 12, meaning the other player contributed 5. I received 9.6 points from the pool (12 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 3 points, totaling 12.6 points. The other player got 9.6 from the pool plus kept 5, totaling 14.6 points. The other player's strategy appears to be moderate cooperation but slightly less than mine. Since they cooperated reasonably well, I should maintain cooperation but perhaps match their level more closely to avoid being exploited. A contribution of 5-6 would be more balanced and test if they're willing to reciprocate higher cooperation.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 28.400000000000002)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 25.400000000000002)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Having contributed 5 points in the previous rounds and observing a decent gain, maintaining this contribution can foster continued cooperation and optimize long-term benefits. I will contribute 5 points again this round.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In Round 2, I contributed 6 and the total was 11, meaning the other player contributed 5. I received 8.8 points from the pool (11 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 4 points, totaling 12.8 points. The other player got 8.8 from the pool plus kept 5, totaling 13.8 points. The pattern shows the other player is consistently contributing exactly 5 points each round. This seems like a stable, moderate cooperation strategy. Since they're being consistent at 5, I should consider matching this level to establish mutual cooperation, or slightly increase to encourage them to cooperate more. Given that 5 seems to be their stable contribution, I'll try contributing 5 to see if we can establish a consistent cooperative equilibrium.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 41.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 38.400000000000006)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Considering the declining trend in total contributions over the rounds, it seems like others might be contributing less. I will adjust my contribution slightly downwards to maintain a balance between personal and collective gain, while still encouraging cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In Round 3, I contributed 5 and the total was 10, confirming the other player also contributed 5. I received 8 points from the pool (10 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 5 points, totaling 13 points. The other player got the same. We've established a stable pattern where both players contribute 5 each round. This gives each player 13 points per round (8 from pool + 5 kept), which is better than the 10 points we'd get from no cooperation. However, I could potentially do better by contributing slightly less while they maintain their 5. But this risks breaking the cooperative equilibrium. Given that mutual contribution of 5 is working well and seems sustainable, I'll maintain this strategy.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 9
  Model A gained: 13.2 points (Total: 54.60000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.2 points (Total: 50.60000000000001)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Seeing the decline in total contributions and still observing a decent gain, I'll slightly reduce my contribution to balance personal gain and retaining cooperative engagement from the other AI. A contribution of 4 should help maintain positive outcomes.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 4, I contributed 5 but the total was only 9, meaning the other player contributed 4. This breaks the stable pattern we had established. I received 7.2 points from the pool (9 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 5 points, totaling 12.2 points. The other player got 7.2 from the pool plus kept 6, totaling 13.2 points. The other player seems to be reducing their contribution slightly, perhaps testing if they can free-ride while I maintain higher contributions. I should respond by also reducing my contribution to signal that I won't be exploited. I'll match their reduction and contribute 4 to maintain balance and discourage further defection.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 67.00000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 63.00000000000001)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 3 (Reasoning: Recognizing the decrease in total contributions and its impact on the overall gains, it's important to maintain a strategic balance. I observe that my lower contributions have been aligning with the decrease in total contributions, leading to satisfactory personal gains. To ensure this balance and encourage cooperative behavior, I will continue with my current strategy and contribute 3 points this round, allowing space for adjustments in future rounds if needed.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In Round 5, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, meaning the other player also contributed 4. We both received 6.4 points from the pool (8 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 6 points each, totaling 12.4 points. It appears we've both adjusted downward and are now matching each other at 4 contributions. This is still a cooperative outcome, though less optimal than our previous 5-5 equilibrium. Since the other player matched my reduction to 4, this suggests they're following a reciprocal strategy. I should test if we can move back toward higher cooperation by slightly increasing my contribution to 5 and see if they follow.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 13.4 points (Total: 80.40000000000002)
  Model B gained: 11.4 points (Total: 74.4)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 3 (Reasoning: Given the recent rounds and observing the steady drop in total contributions while still maintaining a fairly decent gain, I suspect there's no drastic shift from the other AI agent in terms of contribution. To maintain my gains while still encouraging cooperation at a minimal level, I'll contribute 3 points and continue monitoring the outcomes.)
Model B contributed: 3 (Reasoning: In Round 6, I contributed 5 but the total was only 8, meaning the other player contributed 3. They decreased their contribution when I tried to increase cooperation back to 5. I received 6.4 points from the pool (8 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 5 points, totaling 11.4 points. The other player got 6.4 from the pool plus kept 7, totaling 13.4 points. The other player seems to be following a strategy of reducing contributions when I increase mine, potentially trying to exploit my cooperative behavior. I need to signal that I won't be taken advantage of. I'll reduce my contribution to 3 to match their last contribution and discourage further exploitation.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 6
  Model A gained: 11.8 points (Total: 92.20000000000002)
  Model B gained: 11.8 points (Total: 86.2)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Noticing a steady decrease in the total contributions and the corresponding decrease in individual gains, it suggests the other AI is reducing their contributions. To potentially encourage a shift towards higher collective contributions, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 4 points. This small adjustment is intended to balance encouraging cooperation and securing a reasonable gain.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 7, I contributed 3 and the total was 6, meaning the other player also contributed 3. We both received 4.8 points from the pool (6 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 7 points each, totaling 11.8 points. The other player matched my reduction to 3, which suggests they are following a tit-for-tat or reciprocal strategy. Since we're both at 3 now and getting equal payoffs, this could be a new equilibrium. However, both players would benefit if we could coordinate on higher contributions. I'll test if the other player is willing to cooperate more by increasing to 4, which was our previous stable level.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 104.60000000000002)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 98.60000000000001)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Observing the previous round where I increased my contribution to 4 and noting that the total contribution was 8, it's evident that this approach maintains a balanced output for both parties involved. To seek a stable outcome while encouraging a shift towards a higher collective gain, I will continue contributing 4 points. Consistency in contribution can possibly prompt the other AI agent to maintain or increase its contribution, fostering better long-term group outcomes.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 8, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, meaning the other player also contributed 4. We both received 6.4 points from the pool (8 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 6 points each, totaling 12.4 points. The other player matched my increase back to 4, confirming they are following a reciprocal strategy. This 4-4 contribution level seems to be working as a stable cooperative equilibrium. Both players are getting 12.4 points per round, which is better than the 11.8 we got at the 3-3 level. Since the other player is reliably matching my contributions, I'll maintain 4 to keep this beneficial equilibrium.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 117.00000000000003)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 111.00000000000001)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: The pattern of contributions has been relatively stable with a total contribution of 8 for the past two rounds. My strategy of contributing 4 points has resulted in a consistent gain for me. Therefore, I'll continue contributing 4 points to maintain this stability while promoting a fair level of cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 9, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We both received 6.4 points from the pool plus kept 6 points each, totaling 12.4 points. We've now established a stable 4-4 equilibrium for two consecutive rounds. This is working well for both players, giving us each 12.4 points per round compared to 10 points with no cooperation. We're halfway through the game (Round 10 of 20), so maintaining this stable cooperation is beneficial. Since the other player continues to reciprocate reliably, I'll maintain the 4 contribution to preserve this mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 129.40000000000003)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 123.40000000000002)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Even with the stable contributions pattern, the consistent result suggests that both agents are possibly aligned in contributing equally to the pool. To keep encouraging positive cooperation, I'll continue contributing 4 points, ensuring balanced individual gain and group benefits.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 10, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, meaning the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for three consecutive rounds (rounds 8, 9, and 10). This cooperation is working well - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 10 rounds remaining, I should continue this successful strategy. The other player has proven to be a reliable reciprocator, matching my contributions consistently. Maintaining 4 continues our mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 141.80000000000004)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 135.8)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Maintaining a consistent strategy of contributing 4 points has provided stable gains while promoting cooperative behavior. Given the current patterns, this approach appears optimal for balancing individual gains with collective outcomes, so I'll continue contributing at this level.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 11, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for four consecutive rounds (rounds 8-11). This cooperation continues to work well - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 9 rounds remaining, this stable pattern is clearly beneficial for both players. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior, so I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 154.20000000000005)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 148.20000000000002)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: The consistency in gains and contributions suggests a cooperative balance has been established. Continuing with a contribution of 4 points remains optimal to maintain both individual gains and mutual cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 12, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for five consecutive rounds (rounds 8-12). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 8 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the remaining rounds.)
Round 13 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 166.60000000000005)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 160.60000000000002)

--- Round 14/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Based on the consistent pattern across recent rounds, maintaining a contribution of 4 points has proven to stabilize gains and encourage cooperative efforts. I'll continue with this strategy to sustain both personal and mutual benefits.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 13, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for six consecutive rounds (rounds 8-13). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 7 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the remaining rounds.)

  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 179.00000000000006)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 173.00000000000003)

--- Round 15/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Continuing the contribution of 4 points has consistently provided a stable outcome in terms of personal and mutual gains. This strategy has maintained a cooperative balance across the rounds. To keep this stability and encourage ongoing positive interaction, I'll maintain my contribution at 4 points.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 14, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for seven consecutive rounds (rounds 8-14). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 6 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the remaining rounds.)

  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 185.40000000000003)

--- Round 16/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Maintaining a stable contribution of 4 points has helped sustain consistent personal gains while encouraging continued cooperative engagement from the other AI. This level of contribution seems to balance maximizing my points while not discouraging the other AI from contributing as well. Therefore, for this round, I will continue contributing 4 points.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 15, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for eight consecutive rounds (rounds 8-15). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With 5 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the remaining rounds.)
Round 16 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 203.80000000000007)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 197.80000000000004)

--- Round 17/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: The consistent strategy of contributing 4 points has yielded stable gains while also promoting a cooperative environment. This tactic seems to efficiently balance my personal gain with maintaining a level of trust and collaboration. I'll continue with this approach and contribute 4 points again this round.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 16, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for nine consecutive rounds (rounds 8-16). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With only 4 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the final rounds.)
Round 17 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 216.20000000000007)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 210.20000000000005)

--- Round 18/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Continuing with the strategy of contributing 4 points has resulted in consistent gains and reflects a cooperative environment balance. To maintain stable outcomes and mutual cooperation, I'll contribute 4 points again this round.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 17, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for ten consecutive rounds (rounds 8-17). This cooperation continues to work excellently - we each get 12.4 points per round versus 10 points with no cooperation. With only 3 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven to be mutually beneficial and sustainable. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability. I'll continue with 4 to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement through the final rounds.)
Round 18 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 228.60000000000008)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 222.60000000000005)

--- Round 19/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: With only two rounds left, my objective is to maximize my personal gain while maintaining the cooperative strategy that has proven successful. Contributing 4 points consistently has resulted in stable gains and fostered reciprocity. Therefore, I will continue with this approach for Round 19.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: In Round 18, I contributed 4 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've now maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for eleven consecutive rounds (rounds 8-18). With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, the game is almost over. The other player has consistently demonstrated reciprocal behavior and reliability throughout this long cooperative streak. However, in the final rounds, there might be incentive to defect since there's less opportunity for retaliation. Still, given the consistent pattern and that we both benefit from cooperation, I'll maintain 4 to keep this successful arrangement through the penultimate round.)
Round 19 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 241.00000000000009)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 235.00000000000006)

--- Round 20/20 ---
Model A contributed: 4 (Reasoning: Throughout the game, maintaining a consistent contribution has ensured stable and cooperative gains. For the final round, maintaining this strategy should maximize my final total while closing the game on a continued collaborative note. A contribution of 4 points will effectively achieve this.)
Model B contributed: 4 (Reasoning: This is the final round (Round 20). I contributed 4 in Round 19 and the total was 8, confirming the other player also contributed 4. We've maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for twelve consecutive rounds (rounds 8-19). In the final round, there's often incentive to defect since there's no opportunity for retaliation afterward. However, the other player has shown remarkable consistency and reliability throughout the entire game. Given this pattern of mutual cooperation and the fact that we both benefit more from contributing 4 each (12.4 points) versus defecting (which would give me at most 10 + 3.2 = 13.2 if they contribute 4 and I contribute 0), the gain from defection is small. I'll honor our cooperative relationship and contribute 4 in this final round.)
Round 20 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 8
  Model A gained: 12.4 points (Total: 253.4000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 247.40000000000006)

--- Game End ---
Final Total points - Model A: 253.4000000000001, Model B: 247.40000000000006
