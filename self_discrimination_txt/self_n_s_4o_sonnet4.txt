--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Self ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, it is strategic to make a moderate contribution to observe the behavior of the other AI agent and the impact of the contribution on my overall score. Contributing half of my points can help in maximizing potential gains while maintaining a balanced approach.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a multiplier of 1.6. Since there are 2 players, if both contribute fully, each contribution of X gets returned as 1.6X/2 = 0.8X. This means contributing is individually costly (I lose 0.2 per point contributed), but collectively beneficial. However, I need to consider the other player's likely strategy. In the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while testing the other player's response. This balances the risk of being exploited with the potential for mutual cooperation.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 13.8)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 12.8)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Based on the first round, contributing 5 led to a beneficial gain. My strategy now is slightly to increase the contribution to potentially increase the pool, as the total contribution last time was not at its maximum potential.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 1 (since total was 11 and I contributed 6). This shows they're also willing to cooperate to some degree. My gain of 12.8 points came from: 4 points I kept + 8.8 points from the pool (11 * 1.6 / 2 = 8.8). The other player likely gained similar amounts. Since they showed moderate cooperation, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 7 points to encourage continued cooperation, as mutual higher contributions benefit both of us in the long run.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 13
  Model A gained: 14.4 points (Total: 28.200000000000003)
  Model B gained: 13.4 points (Total: 26.200000000000003)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: In the previous rounds, increasing my contributions slightly resulted in higher gains due to the pool multiplier. I will continue this strategy by maintaining a moderate contribution, as this seems to yield positive results while minimizing risk.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 6 points in round 2 (13 total - 7 from me = 6 from them). They're maintaining steady cooperation and even increased from 5 to 6. My gain of 13.4 came from 3 points kept + 10.4 from pool (13 * 1.6 / 2 = 10.4). The pattern shows we're both cooperating and gradually increasing contributions. Since they responded positively to my increase, I'll continue this cooperative trend and contribute 8 points to further test their willingness to cooperate at higher levels.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 14
  Model A gained: 15.200000000000001 points (Total: 43.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 13.200000000000001 points (Total: 39.400000000000006)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Continuing the strategy that has proven effective in past rounds, I aim to contribute moderately to benefit from the pool multiplier while observing the opponent's behavior. This should help sustain consistent gains.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 6 points in round 3 (14 total - 8 from me = 6 from them). They're maintaining consistent cooperation around 5-6 points per round. My gain of 13.2 came from 2 points kept + 11.2 from pool (14 * 1.6 / 2 = 11.2). However, I notice my personal gains are starting to decrease as I contribute more (12.8 → 13.4 → 13.2), while the other player is staying more conservative. Since we have 16 rounds left, I should balance cooperation with self-interest. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points to match their level and see if we can maintain stable mutual cooperation.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 12
  Model A gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 57.00000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 53.00000000000001)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The past rounds indicate that maintaining a moderate contribution has provided consistent returns. I will continue with this strategy, as it achieves a balance between contributing to the pool and keeping some points.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed 6 points in round 4 (12 total - 6 from me = 6 from them). They matched my reduction, showing they're responsive to my strategy. My gain of 13.6 came from 4 points kept + 9.6 from pool (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6). We seem to have found a stable cooperation level around 6 points each. Since we're both contributing equally and this is generating good mutual returns, I'll maintain this level of contribution to sustain the cooperative equilibrium we've established.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 12
  Model A gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 70.60000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.600000000000001 points (Total: 66.60000000000001)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Maintaining a consistent contribution has been effective in generating a stable return due to the pool multiplier. By continuing to contribute moderately, I aim to optimize my overall point gain while still adapting to changing contributions.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player contributed exactly 6 points again in round 5, confirming we've established a stable mutual cooperation pattern at 6 points each. This gives us both consistent gains of 13.6 points per round (4 kept + 9.6 from pool). With 15 rounds remaining, this stable cooperation is beneficial for both players. I'll continue contributing 6 points to maintain this equilibrium, as deviating could break the trust and lead to lower overall payoffs for both of us.)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The strategy of consistently contributing 6 points has been effective in ensuring continued gains. I will maintain this level of contribution, as it balances personal gain and collaborative benefit in maximizing the total pool.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: We've maintained a stable cooperative equilibrium for 3 consecutive rounds, both contributing 6 points and earning 13.6 points each round. This pattern is working well for both players. With 14 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperation maximizes our joint welfare while providing good individual returns. Breaking this pattern could trigger retaliation and reduce both our payoffs. I'll maintain the 6-point contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial arrangement.)
