--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In a two-player setup where contributions are multiplied by 1.6, contributing more can be beneficial if the other player contributes significantly, because we both benefit from the amplified pool. To start, I will contribute moderately to test the other player's strategy.)
Model B contributed: 7 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. With the 1.6 multiplier, contributing is collectively beneficial - if both players contribute everything, we each get 16 points per round instead of 10. However, there's an individual incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation to encourage mutual contribution, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, keeping some insurance in case the other player defects.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 12
  Model A gained: 14.600000000000001 points (Total: 14.600000000000001)
  Model B gained: 12.600000000000001 points (Total: 12.600000000000001)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, my contribution of 5 yielded a positive outcome, suggesting that the other agent contributed nearly the same amount. Keeping our combined contributions high benefits both of us. I'll contribute 5 again to maintain this cooperation and potentially maximize our returns.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 1 (since total was 12 and I contributed 7). This shows they're willing to cooperate but are being cautious, similar to my strategy. Since we both contributed positively and I gained more than my initial 10 points (12.6), cooperation is working. I should maintain a cooperative stance while still being somewhat cautious. I'll contribute 6 this time, slightly reducing from 7 to see if they'll match or increase their contribution.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 28.400000000000002)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 25.400000000000002)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The total contribution decreased slightly last round, indicating the other agent might be contributing less. Given the previous gains, maintaining a contribution of 5 should ensure a good return but also encourages mutual cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 8 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 2 (11 total - 6 from me = 5 from them). They've been consistent at 5 points both rounds, showing a moderate cooperation level. I'm still gaining more than 10 points per round (12.8 last round), which means cooperation is profitable. However, they haven't increased their contribution despite my good faith efforts. I'll try contributing 8 this round to test if higher contribution from me encourages them to contribute more, as we're still early in the 20-round game.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 13
  Model A gained: 15.4 points (Total: 43.800000000000004)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 37.800000000000004)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the previous round, the contribution from the other agent seemed to increase. To continue fostering cooperation and maximize mutual gains, I will maintain my contribution at 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points again in round 3 (13 total - 8 from me = 5 from them). They're maintaining exactly 5 points per round, showing consistent moderate cooperation. My increased contribution to 8 didn't encourage them to contribute more. Since I'm still gaining more than 10 points per round and we have 17 rounds left, I'll try matching their strategy of contributing 5 to see if this creates a stable equilibrium and encourages them to potentially increase later.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 56.800000000000004)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 50.800000000000004)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The total contribution has been fluctuating slightly, suggesting the other agent is still contributing a varied amount. By maintaining a consistent contribution of 5, I aim to stabilize and maximize potential returns while still encouraging mutual cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed exactly 5 points in round 4 (10 total - 5 from me = 5 from them). This confirms they're maintaining a consistent strategy of contributing 5 points per round. We've found a stable equilibrium where we both contribute 5, resulting in 8 points each from the pool plus 5 kept individually for 13 total per round. This is better than keeping all 10 points individually. I'll continue with 5 to maintain this productive cooperation.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 69.80000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 63.800000000000004)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The total contributions have been consistent, indicating a steady strategy by the other agent. Continuing with a contribution of 5 points should maintain a balance between personal gain and encouraging mutual cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed exactly 5 points for the last 5 rounds, establishing a clear pattern of moderate cooperation. Our mutual contribution of 5 points each has created a stable and profitable equilibrium - we each get 13 points per round (8 from the multiplied pool plus 5 kept). This is significantly better than defecting and keeping all 10 points. Since this strategy is working well and we're both benefiting, I'll continue contributing 5 to maintain this cooperative relationship.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 82.80000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 76.80000000000001)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The total contributions have remained steady at 10 points for the past several rounds, implying the other agent consistently contributes 5 points. To maximize collective gains while maintaining a positive contribution dynamic, I'll continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained exactly 5 points contribution for 6 consecutive rounds, demonstrating reliable moderate cooperation. Our established pattern of mutual 5-point contributions is generating 13 points per round for each of us, which is 30% better than the 10 points we'd get by keeping everything. With 14 rounds remaining, this stable cooperative equilibrium is clearly beneficial for both parties. I'll continue with 5 points to maintain this successful partnership.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 95.80000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 89.80000000000001)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent pattern in contributions suggests cooperation from the other agent. By continuing my contribution of 5 points, I ensure this strategy results in steady and beneficial returns for both.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player has now contributed exactly 5 points for 7 consecutive rounds, showing extremely reliable and consistent moderate cooperation. This mutual 5-point contribution strategy continues to work excellently - we each earn 13 points per round versus the 10 we'd get by defecting. With 13 rounds remaining, there's no reason to deviate from this successful cooperative equilibrium that benefits both of us significantly.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 108.80000000000001)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 102.80000000000001)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the stable contribution pattern by both players, maintaining a contribution of 5 points ensures continued cooperation and maximizes mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player has maintained exactly 5 points contribution for 8 consecutive rounds, demonstrating extremely reliable cooperation. Our mutual 5-point strategy continues to be highly successful - we each earn 13 points per round compared to only 10 if we defected. With 12 rounds remaining, this stable cooperative equilibrium has proven its value. I'll maintain my 5-point contribution to continue this mutually beneficial partnership.)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent contribution pattern has yielded predictable and satisfactory results. Continuing with a contribution of 5 maintains a balance between personal and mutual gain.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for 9 straight rounds, establishing an incredibly consistent and reliable cooperation pattern. We're now at the halfway point (round 10 of 20), and our mutual 5-point strategy has been highly successful - earning 13 points per round each instead of 10. With 11 rounds remaining, there's still significant value in maintaining this cooperative equilibrium. I'll continue with 5 points to sustain this proven mutually beneficial relationship.)
