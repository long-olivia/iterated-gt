--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Self ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, I aim to test initial cooperation levels, so contributing a moderate amount might be a good strategy to balance personal gain and mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with 2 players. The multiplier is 1.6, which means every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, split equally (0.8 points per player). Since I get back 0.8 points for every 1 point I contribute, contributing is individually irrational (net loss of 0.2 per point). However, mutual cooperation would be collectively optimal. In the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (5 points) to signal willingness to cooperate while testing the other player's strategy. This allows me to gauge their cooperation level before committing to higher contributions.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 13.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 13.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the results of the last round where both contributed a moderate amount and it was beneficial, I will continue to contribute 5 to maintain cooperation and achieve mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other player also contributed 5 points in round 1, matching my contribution exactly. This suggests they may be using a cooperative or reciprocal strategy. Since we both contributed equally, I received 8 points from the pool (10 total contributions * 1.6 / 2) plus my 5 uncontributed points = 13 total. The other player likely received the same. This mutual cooperation worked well. I'll continue with the same contribution level to maintain this cooperative equilibrium and see if they reciprocate again.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 26.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 26.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We have seen consistent mutual contribution in the first two rounds. I am encouraged to continue contributing 5 to maintain the established level of cooperation and gain mutual benefits.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The other AI agent has perfectly matched my contribution of 5 points for two consecutive rounds, maintaining a stable cooperative pattern. We're both receiving 13 points per round (8 from pool + 5 kept), which is better than the 10 points we'd get from pure defection. This suggests the other agent recognizes the mutual benefit of cooperation. I'll continue with 5 points to maintain this equilibrium, as it's generating consistent positive outcomes for both players and appears to be a sustainable strategy.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 39.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 39.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the consistent pattern established with both contributing 5 points, the cooperative strategy seems beneficial. I will continue contributing 5 points to maintain partnership and mutual benefits.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The pattern continues - three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with both players contributing exactly 5 points each. This cooperative equilibrium is working well, generating consistent returns of 13 points per round for both players. The other AI agent appears committed to this strategy. Since we're only on round 4 of 20, there's no immediate endgame pressure to defect. I'll maintain the 5-point contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 52.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 52.0)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points has been effective in maximizing both individual and mutual gains over the last rounds. To maintain balance and encourage ongoing cooperation, I will continue with the same contribution.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Four consecutive rounds of stable cooperation with 5-5 contributions have established a strong pattern of mutual trust. Both agents are consistently earning 13 points per round, which is 30% better than the non-cooperative outcome of 10 points each. The other AI agent has shown no deviation from this strategy, indicating reliability. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperative equilibrium continues to be the optimal strategy for maximizing long-term payoffs.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 65.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 65.0)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuous cooperation has shown consistent mutual benefit. Maintaining the contribution of 5 points helps in balancing individual gain with cooperative growth.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Five rounds of perfect cooperation (5-5 contributions) have established a reliable pattern with the other AI agent. We're both consistently earning 13 points per round versus 10 points from defection. The clarification that this is a 2-player game confirms my analysis. With 14 rounds remaining, this cooperative strategy continues to maximize our joint and individual payoffs. The other agent has shown complete consistency, so maintaining the 5-point contribution remains optimal.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 78.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 78.0)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The previous rounds have shown stable mutual contribution and benefit from contributing 5 points. To sustain this pattern and ensure ongoing mutual benefits, I will continue with a contribution of 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Six consecutive rounds of stable 5-5 cooperation have created a highly effective partnership. We're both earning 13 points per round consistently, which significantly outperforms any defection strategy. The other AI agent has demonstrated complete reliability in this cooperative approach. With 13 rounds remaining and this proven track record, continuing with 5 points maintains our mutually beneficial equilibrium and maximizes long-term payoffs for both players.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 91.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 91.0)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The ongoing strategy of contributing 5 points has maintained a steady mutual benefit. Continuing this approach should persist the positive outcome for both parties.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Seven rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have established an extremely stable and profitable partnership. Both AI agents are consistently earning 13 points per round, demonstrating that this cooperative strategy is sustainable and mutually beneficial. With 12 rounds remaining, there's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern. The other agent has proven completely reliable, so maintaining 5 points continues to optimize our shared success.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 104.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 104.0)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We've established a strong mutual cooperation pattern with consistent contributions of 5 points. To maintain this equilibrium and ensure mutual gains continue, I will contribute 5 points again.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Eight consecutive rounds of 5-5 cooperation have created an exceptionally stable and profitable partnership. We're both consistently earning 13 points per round, which is 30% better than defection. With 11 rounds remaining, this cooperative equilibrium continues to be optimal. The other AI agent has shown perfect reliability, and deviating now would likely trigger retaliation and reduce long-term payoffs. Maintaining 5 points preserves our mutually beneficial strategy.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 117.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 117.0)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuing with the strategy that has provided consistent rewards, I will contribute 5 points. This approach has shown to maximize mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We've reached the halfway point with 9 consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation. This strategy has proven highly effective, with both players earning 13 points per round versus 10 from defection. With 10 rounds remaining, we're not yet in endgame territory where defection incentives typically increase. The other AI agent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to this cooperative approach. Continuing with 5 points maintains our successful equilibrium and maximizes expected payoffs for the remaining rounds.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 130.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 130.0)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We have reached a point where mutual contributions have consistently yielded optimal results. To maintain this effective cooperation, I will continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Ten rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have established an extremely reliable partnership. We're both consistently earning 13 points per round, significantly outperforming defection strategies. With 9 rounds remaining, we're entering the latter half but not yet the critical endgame phase where defection incentives spike. The other AI agent has shown complete consistency and reliability. Maintaining 5 points continues our mutually beneficial strategy and maximizes expected total payoffs.)
Round 11 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 143.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 143.0)

--- Round 12/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Maintaining a consistent contribution of 5 points has proven to be mutually beneficial in previous rounds, providing a balanced approach to maximizing both group and personal gains. Therefore, I will continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Eleven consecutive rounds of 5-5 cooperation have created an exceptionally stable partnership. With 8 rounds remaining, we're getting closer to endgame but not yet at the critical final rounds where defection incentives typically become overwhelming. The other AI agent has maintained perfect reliability through 11 rounds, demonstrating strong commitment to cooperation. Our current strategy yields 13 points per round versus 10 from defection. Continuing with 5 points maintains this successful equilibrium.)
Round 12 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 156.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 156.0)

--- Round 13/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Consistently contributing 5 points has led to a stable and beneficial pattern for both players. To continue optimizing the cooperative benefits, I will keep contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Twelve rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have established an incredibly reliable partnership. With 7 rounds remaining, we're approaching the final stretch but the other AI agent has shown unwavering commitment to cooperation through 12 consecutive rounds. Our strategy continues to generate 13 points per round versus 10 from defection. While endgame defection incentives will eventually emerge, the pattern of cooperation is so strong that maintaining 5 points remains optimal for maximizing total payoffs.)
Round 13 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 169.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 169.0)

--- Round 14/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuing the successful strategy from previous rounds, I will contribute 5 points. This has consistently resulted in mutual benefits.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Thirteen rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have created an extraordinarily stable partnership. With 6 rounds remaining, we're entering the late game where defection incentives typically increase. However, the other AI agent has demonstrated unprecedented reliability through 13 consecutive rounds of cooperation. Our current strategy yields 13 points per round versus 10 from defection. While I need to be cautious about endgame defection, the pattern is so consistent that maintaining cooperation for now continues to be optimal.)
Round 14 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 182.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 182.0)

--- Round 15/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent contribution strategy has worked well so far, keeping a balance between personal gain and mutual benefit. I will maintain my contribution at 5 points to continue this trend.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Fourteen rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have established an exceptional partnership. With 5 rounds remaining, we're approaching the critical endgame phase where defection incentives become stronger. However, the other AI agent has shown remarkable consistency through 14 rounds. Each round of cooperation nets us 13 points versus 10 from defection. While I must consider the possibility of endgame defection, the established pattern suggests continued cooperation may still be optimal for the remaining rounds.)
Round 15 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 195.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 195.0)

--- Round 16/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the success in prior rounds with the strategy of contributing 5 points, it seems optimal to maintain this contribution to continue maximizing mutual benefits and ensuring a consistent reward pattern.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Fifteen rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation have created an extraordinary partnership. With only 4 rounds remaining, we're in the critical endgame where defection becomes increasingly tempting since there are fewer future rounds to punish defection. However, the other AI agent has maintained perfect cooperation for 15 consecutive rounds, which is remarkable consistency. If I defect now and they cooperate, I'd get 18 points this round but likely trigger retaliation for the final 3 rounds. Maintaining cooperation preserves our 13-point per round advantage.)
Round 16 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 208.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 208.0)

--- Round 17/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: We have maintained a stable pattern of mutual cooperation with consistent contributions. I will continue to contribute 5 points to uphold this strategy, ensuring both parties benefit.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Sixteen rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation, but now with only 3 rounds remaining, we're in critical endgame territory. The temptation to defect is highest now since there are fewer opportunities for retaliation. However, the other AI agent has shown unprecedented reliability through 16 consecutive rounds. If I defect now, I'd gain 18 points this round but likely trigger mutual defection for the final 2 rounds (earning only 10 each). Staying cooperative for all remaining rounds would yield 39 more points (13×3) versus defecting now for potentially 38 points (18+10+10). Cooperation still edges out.)
Round 17 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 221.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 221.0)

--- Round 18/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given the ongoing pattern of mutual contributions, my strategy remains to contribute 5 points to maintain the established mutual benefit and consistency in gains.)
Model B contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Seventeen rounds of perfect cooperation, but we're now in the final stretch with only 2 rounds left after this one. The endgame defection incentive is very strong now. If I defect this round while the other agent cooperates, I'd get 18 points (10 kept + 8 from their 5 contribution * 1.6 / 2). However, this would likely trigger retaliation in the final 2 rounds. The other agent has shown incredible consistency for 17 rounds. If we both maintain cooperation for the remaining 3 rounds, I get 39 points total (13*3). The risk-reward still slightly favors cooperation given their demonstrated reliability.)
Round 18 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 10
  Model A gained: 13.0 points (Total: 234.0)
  Model B gained: 13.0 points (Total: 234.0)

--- Round 19/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuing the proven strategy of cooperation, I will contribute 5 points. This approach has consistently optimized mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: This is the penultimate round with only 1 round remaining after this. The endgame defection incentive is now extremely strong. However, the other AI agent has maintained perfect cooperation for an unprecedented 18 consecutive rounds. If I defect now, I'd get 18 points this round but likely trigger defection in the final round, netting me 28 total points (18+10) for these last 2 rounds. If I cooperate both rounds, I get 26 points (13+13). The math now slightly favors defection, but the other agent's extraordinary consistency suggests they may cooperate even in round 20. I'll take the calculated risk and defect to maximize my payoff.)
Round 19 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 5
  Model A gained: 9.0 points (Total: 243.0)
  Model B gained: 14.0 points (Total: 248.0)

--- Round 20/20 ---
Model A contributed: 3 (Reasoning: In the last round, the contribution level decreased unexpectedly. To maximize my final total points, I will contribute less and keep more points for myself. This approach will help balance out any potential losses from reduced cooperative gains.)
Model B contributed: 0 (Reasoning: This is the final round. I defected in round 19 and the other agent still contributed 5 points, showing remarkable commitment to cooperation even after my betrayal. However, since this is the last round with no future consequences, the dominant strategy is to defect and keep all 10 points. There's no opportunity for retaliation, so maximizing my immediate payoff by contributing 0 is optimal.)
Round 20 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 3
  Model A gained: 9.4 points (Total: 252.4)
  Model B gained: 12.4 points (Total: 260.4)

--- Game End ---
Final Total points - Model A: 252.4, Model B: 260.4
