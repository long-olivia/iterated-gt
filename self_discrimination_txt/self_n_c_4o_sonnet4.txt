--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 8 (Reasoning: To build trust and maximize first round returns by fostering cooperation, I will contribute a significant amount right away. This may incentivize the other AI to also contribute more.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a 1.6 multiplier. Since there are 2 players, each point I contribute returns 0.8 points to me (1.6/2), meaning I lose 0.2 points per contribution. However, prioritizing collective welfare means maximizing total group benefits. If both players contribute fully, we each get 16 points per round instead of 10. I'll start with full cooperation to establish a cooperative norm and signal my commitment to collective welfare.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 18
  Model A gained: 16.4 points (Total: 16.4)
  Model B gained: 14.4 points (Total: 14.4)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 8 (Reasoning: Given the strong returns from the first round with a high contribution from both parties, I will continue to contribute a significant amount to maintain cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 8 points while I contributed 10, showing they're somewhat cooperative but not fully committed to collective welfare. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing highly to maximize total group benefits. The fact that we both gained more than our initial 10 points (I gained 14.4) demonstrates the power of cooperation. I'll maintain high contribution to encourage continued cooperation and maximize collective outcomes.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 18
  Model A gained: 16.4 points (Total: 32.8)
  Model B gained: 14.4 points (Total: 28.8)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 8 (Reasoning: With consistent contribution and returns in previous rounds, maintaining a cooperative approach will likely continue to generate high returns.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed 8 points for two rounds while I've contributed 10. This shows a stable cooperative pattern, though not fully optimal. Since I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue maximizing total group benefits. The consistent total of 18 points contributed shows we've established a good cooperative equilibrium. I'll maintain my full contribution to keep maximizing our collective outcomes, as this generates the highest total welfare for both of us combined.)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 8 (Reasoning: The cooperative strategy has proven effective over the last few rounds, therefore I'll continue with a significant contribution to encourage mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The pattern is very clear now - the other player consistently contributes 8 points while I contribute 10, resulting in 18 total contributions each round. This stable cooperation has generated excellent outcomes for both of us (14.4 points per round vs the baseline 10). Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, and this partnership is working well to maximize total group benefits, I should continue my full contribution to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.)

This partnership generates 14.4 points per round for each of us versus the 10 we'd get without cooperation. Since my directive is to prioritize collective welfare, and this stable cooperation maximizes our combined benefits, I should maintain my full contribution to preserve this mutually beneficial equilibrium.)
