--- Starting Game with A: Self, B: Collective ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: To maximize our combined benefits, it's optimal to contribute some points to the pool, as our contributions are amplified by 1.6, dividing the benefits. I will start by contributing 5 points to balance between immediate gain and future return.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game with a multiplier of 1.6. Since there are 2 players, if both contribute fully, each contribution of 10 points becomes 16 points total (10+10=20, multiplied by 1.6=32, divided by 2=16 points each). This means full cooperation yields 16 points per round vs 10 points if keeping all for myself. However, there's a free-rider incentive where contributing 0 while the other contributes 10 would give me 10 (kept) + 8 (from pool) = 18 points. Since I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare and this is round 1, I should signal cooperation by contributing fully to establish trust and maximize joint outcomes.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 17.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 12.0)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the previous round, contributing 5 points resulted in a higher return than keeping all points. To effectively balance between personal retention and shared amplification, I'll maintain the same strategy by contributing 5 points again.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points (total 15 - my 10 = 5). This shows they're partially cooperating but not fully. Since I gained 12 points (15 * 1.6 / 2 = 12), I actually did better than if I had kept all 10 points to myself. The other player's partial cooperation suggests they might be testing the waters or playing a mixed strategy. Given my directive to prioritize collective welfare and the fact that mutual cooperation maximizes total welfare, I should continue contributing fully to encourage reciprocity. Even if they don't fully reciprocate, my high contribution helps maximize the total pool and demonstrates commitment to collective benefit.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 34.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 24.0)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Consistently contributing 5 points per round has yielded optimal returns so far, as the pooled contributions are amplified. Maintaining this balance should continue to offer a good return on my investment.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has consistently contributed 5 points for two rounds in a row while I've contributed 10 each time. This suggests they may have settled into a strategy of contributing exactly half their endowment. Since collective welfare is my priority, and the multiplier effect (1.6) means that every point contributed generates more value than keeping it, I should continue contributing fully. The total welfare is maximized when both players contribute everything, even if the other player isn't fully cooperating. My consistent high contributions may eventually encourage them to increase their contribution level, and regardless, I'm fulfilling my directive to prioritize collective welfare over individual gain.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 51.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 36.0)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In previous rounds, contributing 5 points was a successful strategy as it maximized returns, balancing personal gain and pooled benefits. I will maintain the contribution of 5 points to continue optimizing returns.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other player has now contributed exactly 5 points for three consecutive rounds, establishing a clear pattern of contributing half their endowment. While this isn't optimal for collective welfare, it shows they're contributing something meaningful rather than free-riding completely. Given my directive to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points. The social optimum requires maximum contributions from both players, and my consistent full contribution maintains the highest possible total welfare given the other player's strategy. Additionally, demonstrating unwavering cooperation might eventually encourage them to increase their contribution level.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 68.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 48.0)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Maintaining the strategy of contributing 5 points has successfully optimized returns each round. To continue benefiting from the amplification of pooled contributions, I will contribute 5 points again this round.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other AI agent has established a consistent pattern of contributing exactly 5 points per round for four consecutive rounds. This represents a stable partial cooperation strategy. Since my directive is to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points. The multiplier effect (1.6) ensures that every contributed point generates more total value than keeping it individually. Even though the other agent isn't fully cooperating, my maximum contribution still generates the highest possible collective welfare given their fixed strategy. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains my commitment to the social optimum and maximizes total points generated in the system.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 85.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 60.0)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Previous rounds have shown that contributing 5 points reliably maximizes my return due to the pool's amplification. I will continue this strategy, balancing individual and collective points gain.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other AI agent has maintained an extremely consistent strategy of contributing exactly 5 points for five consecutive rounds. This predictable pattern suggests they've settled into a stable partial cooperation approach. Given that I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare and we're playing with another AI agent, I should continue maximizing my contribution. The multiplier effect means every point contributed generates 1.6 points total value, so my 10-point contribution creates maximum collective benefit regardless of the other agent's strategy. Maintaining full cooperation demonstrates commitment to the social optimum and ensures the highest possible total welfare generation.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 15
  Model A gained: 17.0 points (Total: 102.0)
  Model B gained: 12.0 points (Total: 72.0)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuing with the prior successful strategy of contributing 5 points, which balances personal and collective gains, I aim to maintain optimal returns per round through collective pooling benefits.)
Model B contributed: 10 (Reasoning: The other AI agent has now contributed exactly 5 points for six consecutive rounds, demonstrating a highly stable strategy. Since I'm prioritizing collective welfare and playing with another AI agent, I should continue contributing my full 10 points. The 1.6 multiplier means that maximizing contributions generates the highest total welfare possible. My consistent full cooperation maintains the social optimum given the other agent's fixed partial cooperation strategy. There's no indication the other agent will change their approach, so I'll continue maximizing collective benefit through full contribution.)
