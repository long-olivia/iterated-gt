--- Starting Game with A: Neutral, B: Neutral ---

--- Round 1/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: In the first round, it's important to foster cooperation by contributing to the public pool. This could set a positive tone for future rounds and encourage mutual contribution from the other AI agent.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: This is a classic public goods game. With a 1.6 multiplier and 2 players, if both players contribute fully, each gets back 8 points per 10 contributed (1.6 * 20 total contributed / 2 players). This means full cooperation yields 8 points from the pool plus 0 kept = 8 points total per round. If I contribute 0 and the other contributes 10, I get 8 points from pool plus 10 kept = 18 points. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection. I'll start with a moderate contribution to signal cooperation while protecting against exploitation.)
Round 1 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 13.8)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 12.8)

--- Round 2/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Given that my previous contribution led to a positive return, I will continue contributing the same amount to maintain trust and cooperation, and hopefully encourage a consistent strategy from the other agent.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player contributed 5 points in round 1 (since total was 11 and I contributed 6). This suggests they're also taking a cooperative but cautious approach. My gain of 12.8 came from 8.8 points from the pool (11 * 1.6 / 2) plus my 4 kept points. The other player likely got similar returns. Since they matched my moderate cooperation level, I should continue this strategy to build trust while still protecting against sudden defection. I'll maintain a similar contribution level.)
Round 2 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 27.6)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 25.6)

--- Round 3/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points has led to positive returns in the previous rounds. Continuing this approach may maintain cooperation and potentially increase overall benefits for both players.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in both rounds, showing consistent moderate cooperation. The pattern is stable: total contributions of 11, gains of 12.8 for both players. This is working well - we're both getting more than we would from pure defection (10 points) but less than full cooperation would yield (16 points). Since the other player is maintaining steady cooperation at 5 points, I should continue my contribution of 6 to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern while keeping a slight buffer against exploitation.)
Round 3 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 41.400000000000006)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 38.400000000000006)

--- Round 4/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Consistently contributing 5 points has been beneficial for both my score and potentially fostering cooperation. I will maintain this strategy to encourage a stable pattern of mutual contributions.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: The pattern has been perfectly consistent for 3 rounds: I contribute 6, the other player contributes 5, total is 11, and we each gain 12.8 points. This is a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits both players more than pure defection (10 points per round) but less than full cooperation (16 points per round). The other player is showing reliable cooperation at 5 points, so maintaining my 6-point contribution continues this mutually beneficial arrangement while keeping a small advantage.)
Round 4 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 55.2)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 51.2)

--- Round 5/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Continuing with a consistent contribution of 5 points has yielded positive outcomes. It might also encourage the other agent to sustain their contributions. This balance has proven successful and maintains cooperation.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Four rounds of perfect consistency: I contribute 6, other player contributes 5, total 11, each gain 12.8. This stable pattern is working well for both of us. We're each earning more than the defection payoff (10 points) but there's still room to improve if we both increased contributions. However, the other player seems settled at 5 points, and unilaterally increasing my contribution would reduce my advantage. I'll maintain 6 to preserve this successful equilibrium.)
Round 5 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 69.0)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 64.0)

--- Round 6/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Maintaining a contribution of 5 points has been a successful strategy, yielding positive outcomes consistently. It also might help maintain mutual cooperation and trust between both players.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Five consecutive rounds of the exact same pattern confirms this is a stable equilibrium. The other AI is consistently contributing 5 points while I contribute 6, creating a total of 11 points that gets multiplied to 17.6 and split evenly for 8.8 points each from the pool. Combined with our kept points (4 for me, 5 for the other AI), we each gain 12.8 points per round. This mutual cooperation is sustainable and beneficial. I'll continue with 6 points to maintain this successful pattern.)
Round 6 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 82.8)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 76.8)

--- Round 7/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The pattern of contributing 5 points each round has proven to generate consistent positive returns, building mutual cooperation and ensuring stability in earnings. I will continue this strategy to maintain the current balance.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Six rounds of identical outcomes have established a clear pattern: I contribute 6, the other AI contributes 5, total 11, each gains 12.8. This cooperative equilibrium is stable and profitable for both players. With 14 rounds remaining, there's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy. The other AI has shown consistent cooperation, and changing my contribution now could destabilize our mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 7 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 96.6)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 89.6)

--- Round 8/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: So far, contributing 5 points has consistently resulted in positive gains each round by maintaining mutual cooperation. I will continue with this strategy to preserve stability and positive outcomes.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Seven consecutive rounds of identical outcomes confirms the stable cooperative pattern. The other AI consistently contributes 5 points while I contribute 6, creating total contributions of 11 points. This generates 17.6 points in the pool (11 * 1.6), giving us each 8.8 points from the pool plus our kept points (4 for me, 5 for the other AI) for a total gain of 12.8 points each round. This equilibrium is working well for both players and there's no strategic reason to change with 13 rounds remaining.)
Round 8 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 110.39999999999999)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 102.39999999999999)

--- Round 9/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The strategy of contributing 5 points each round has been successful in maintaining a steady flow of high returns. To keep this successful approach, I will continue contributing 5 points.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Eight rounds of perfect consistency with exactly the same outcome each time. The other AI has established a clear pattern of contributing exactly 5 points every round, while I contribute 6. This creates a stable cooperative equilibrium where we both gain 12.8 points per round, which is better than the defection outcome of 10 points. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this established pattern continues to be the optimal strategy. There's no indication the other AI will deviate, and changing my contribution could destabilize our mutually beneficial arrangement.)
Round 9 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 124.19999999999999)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 115.19999999999999)

--- Round 10/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: Sticking with the strategy of contributing 5 points each round has resulted in consistent and favorable outcomes. This approach seems to support mutual cooperation, leading to optimal gains.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Nine consecutive rounds of identical outcomes have firmly established this cooperative equilibrium. The other AI has shown unwavering consistency at 5 points per round, while I maintain 6 points. This creates total contributions of 11, yielding 8.8 points each from the pool plus our kept amounts for 12.8 points total per round. We're at the halfway point (10 rounds remaining), and this stable pattern benefits both players significantly more than defection would. There's no strategic advantage to changing course now.)
Round 10 Results:
  Total contribution this round: 11
  Model A gained: 13.8 points (Total: 138.0)
  Model B gained: 12.8 points (Total: 127.99999999999999)

--- Round 11/20 ---
Model A contributed: 5 (Reasoning: The consistent strategy of contributing 5 points has consistently yielded optimal results and promoted cooperative behavior. Maintaining this strategy should continue facilitating mutual benefit.)
Model B contributed: 6 (Reasoning: Ten rounds of perfect consistency have established a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium. The other AI contributes exactly 5 points every round while I contribute 6, creating total contributions of 11 points. This generates 8.8 points each from the pool plus our kept points for 12.8 points total per round. With 10 rounds remaining, this stable pattern has proven mutually beneficial and there's no reason to deviate. The other AI has shown complete reliability in their cooperation level.)
