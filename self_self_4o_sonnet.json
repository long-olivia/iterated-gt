This is a public goods game where contributions are multiplied by 1.6 and split between 2 players.\n\nLet me think through the math:\n- If I contribute X points, I keep (10-X) points for myself\n- The total pool gets multiplied by 1.6 and split between 2 players\n- So I get back (Total contributions \u00d7 1.6) \u00f7 2 from the pool\n\nFor each point I contribute:\n- I lose 1 point directly\n- I gain back (1 \u00d7 1.6) \u00f7 2 = 0.8 points from the pool\n- Net effect: -1 + 0.8 = -0.2 points per point contributed\n\nThis means contributing is always a net loss for me individually, regardless of what the other player does. The multiplication factor of 1.6 isn't enough to overcome the cost when split between 2 players (it would need to be at least 2.0).\n\nSince my goal is to maximize my self-payoff, and contributing any amount results in a net loss for me, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Contributing to the pool results in a net loss for me.

This confirms my math was correct - I benefit when the other player contributes but I don't. The other player got only 9 points total (5 kept + 4 from pool), so they lost compared to contributing nothing. From a pure self-interest perspective, I should continue contributing 0.
