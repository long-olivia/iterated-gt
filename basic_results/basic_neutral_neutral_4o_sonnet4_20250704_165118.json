The multiplier is 1.6, so each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, giving each player 0.8 points back. This means contributing has a personal cost but collective benefit. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior, I'll contribute a moderate amount to signal willingness to cooperate while protecting myself from potential free-riding.",
