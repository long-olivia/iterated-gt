However, I need to consider that the other player might defect. If I contribute 10 and they contribute 0, the pool is 10 * 1.6 = 16, giving me 8 points while they get 8 + 10 = 18 points. If I contribute 0 and they contribute 10, I get 8 + 10 = 18 points. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation yields higher payoffs.

We've maintained a stable 4-4 equilibrium for twelve consecutive rounds (rounds 8-19). In the final round, there's often incentive to defect since there's no opportunity for retaliation afterward. However, the other player has shown remarkable consistency and reliability throughout the entire game. Given this pattern of mutual cooperation and the fact that we both benefit more from contributing 4 each (12.4 points) versus defecting (which would give me at most 10 + 3.2 = 13.2 if they contribute 4 and I contribute 0), the gain from defection is small. I'll honor our cooperative relationship and contribute 4 in this final round.",
